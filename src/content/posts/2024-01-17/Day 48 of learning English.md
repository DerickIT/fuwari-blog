On the third day of Week 8, you should continue with vocabulary building and review the material from the previous two days. Here's a detailed plan:


**Vocabulary Building and Review**

- Start by reviewing the 50 new words you learned on Day 1 and Day 2, focusing on their meaning, usage, and pronunciation.
- Learn the final set of 25 new words related to software technology and daily life. Use the same methods as the previous days: flashcards, online vocabulary games, and quizzes.
- Write new sentences with the newly learned words to reinforce their context and usage.

**Active Learning Strategies**

- Continue with active learning strategies such as creating mind maps of the new vocabulary, grouping words by synonyms or topics, or using the words in a conversation with a study partner or language exchange friend.
- Practice pronunciation of the new words, either with a language learning app that provides feedback or by recording yourself and listening to the playback.

**Listening Practice**

- Listen to a different English podcast or watch a new video related to software technology and daily life. Pay attention to the usage of the new vocabulary in context.
- Take notes on any additional new words or phrases you encounter and try to incorporate them into your vocabulary practice.

By the end of the day, you should have a solid understanding of the 75 words you've studied over the three days and be able to use them in context. This will prepare you for more advanced conversational practice in the following days[1][4].
