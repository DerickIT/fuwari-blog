On the sixth day of the fourth week, your learning tasks should focus on speaking skills and practicing the present simple tense with adverbs of frequency. Here's a specific plan for the day:


### Speaking Skills

- Practice speaking English out loud. This could be through having a conversation with a language exchange partner, speaking to yourself, or repeating phrases from English media.
- Focus on using the vocabulary and grammar you've learned this week in your conversations.

### Vocabulary

- Review the 40 words you've learned this week. Practice their pronunciation and usage in sentences.

### Grammar

- Continue practicing the present simple tense, focusing on forming negative sentences and questions. Also, practice using adverbs of frequency (always, usually, often, sometimes, rarely, never) in sentences.
	- Example: "I always check my emails in the morning." "Does he often work late?"

### Practice

- Create sentences using the vocabulary you've learned, incorporating adverbs of frequency and the present simple tense.
- Try to use the new grammar and vocabulary in your spoken English practice.

### Verification

- To verify your study results, you will be asked to use the vocabulary and grammar you've learned in conversation. You should also be able to respond to questions and express your ideas using the present simple tense and adverbs of frequency[1][2].

On the sixth day of the fourth week, you should continue to review and practice the vocabulary you've learned throughout the week. Here are some specific words to focus on:
