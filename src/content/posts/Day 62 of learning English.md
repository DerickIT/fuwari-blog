On the third day of Week 10, you should focus on the following tasks:

1. **Phonemic Awareness**: Continue practicing the sounds of the letters Hh (/h/) and start working on the sounds of the letter Ww (/w/). Engage in phonics exercises to reinforce these sounds[4].
2. **High-Frequency Words**: Keep practicing the high-frequency words you've been focusing on, such as "as," "has," "want"[4].
3. **Comprehension Skills**: Further develop your comprehension skills by identifying story details, focusing on the setting of the stories you read[4].
4. **Reading**: Read additional texts that include the new vocabulary words, paying special attention to understanding the context in which they are used[4].
5. **Interactive Activities**: Play educational games that reinforce the vocabulary and phonemic awareness you've been working on. You can continue with "Old Maid" or similar games that use the vocabulary cards[4].
6. **Vocabulary Practice**: Review the flashcards you created and practice using the new vocabulary words in sentences or short paragraphs[5].

Remember to review the material from the previous days to reinforce your learning and ensure retention.
