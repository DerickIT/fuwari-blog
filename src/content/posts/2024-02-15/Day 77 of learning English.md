### Week 12, Day 4: Real-life Conversation Simulation


**Learning Content:**

- **Role-Play Scenarios:** Prepare and practice role-play scenarios that mimic real-life situations such as job interviews, social networking events, or customer service interactions.
- **Functional Language:** Focus on learning phrases and expressions used in specific contexts, like making requests, giving opinions, agreeing and disagreeing, and handling complaints.
- **Cultural Nuances:** Understand and incorporate cultural nuances and politeness strategies that are typical in English-speaking countries.

**Testing Standards:**

- **Role-Play Performance:** Your ability to handle different roles and scenarios will be assessed. You should demonstrate appropriate use of language, adaptability to various situations, and cultural understanding.
- **Language Functionality:** You will be evaluated on your use of functional language within the context of the role-play. This includes the correct application of phrases for making requests, expressing opinions, and other conversational functions.
- **Feedback Reception:** After the role-play, you will receive feedback on your performance. This will include comments on your fluency, pronunciation, and use of expressions, as well as how well you managed the cultural aspects of the interaction.

**Verification:**

- **Recorded Role-Plays:** Record your role-play sessions for self-review and to receive feedback from me or a peer. This allows you to observe your language use and non-verbal communication.
- **Peer Review:** Engage in peer review sessions where you and your classmates can provide constructive feedback to each other on the role-play performances.

By engaging in these real-life conversation simulations, you will improve your ability to use English in a variety of contexts, which is essential for achieving conversational fluency in both social and professional settings.
