Okay, today we're gonna talk about working from home. This is a good topic because many people work remotely nowadays. Working remotely means you don't work in an office, you stay home and you use your computer or other technology to work. I work from home and I think there are positives and negatives to this. Let's talk about them.


_今天我们要聊聊在家工作。这是一个好话题，因为现在很多人远程工作。远程工作意味着你不是在办公室工作，你待在家里，使用你的电脑或其他技术来工作。我在家工作，我认为这样做有优点也有缺点。让我们来聊聀它们。_


First, let's start with the positives. If you work from home, you don't need to commute to work. You don't have to drive to work in the morning or drive back home in the evening. This is great because you don't have to worry about traffic in the morning and in the evening. There are many cars on the road because many people are commuting to and from work. Some people get stuck in this traffic every day.


_首先，让我们从积极的一面开始。如果你在家工作，你不需要通勤上班。你早上不需要开车去上班，晚上也不需要开车回家。这很棒，因为你不需要担心早晚的交通。路上有很多车，因为很多人正在上下班通勤。有些人每天都会陷入这种交通中。_


This is one of my favorite things about working from home. It saves you a lot of time. Another thing is that you can feel more relaxed when you work from home. You can wear casual clothes, you can take breaks when you're tired, and you can work in any room. I feel pretty comfortable working from home. It's not too formal and I feel free. If you work in an office, there are more rules and it's less comfortable.


_这是我在家工作最喜欢的事情之一。它可以为你节省很多时间。另一点是，在家工作时你可以感到更加放松。你可以穿休闲装，累了可以休息，而且你可以在任何房间工作。我觉得在家工作非常舒适。它不那么正式，我感到自由。如果你在办公室工作，规则更多，舒适度也较低。_


One other positive about working from home is being able to spend more time with your family. For example, if you have a break, you can go in the other room and spend time with your family. When you work at an office, you don't have your family with you, so you can't do this. I love eating breakfast or lunch with my family when I have breaks. This is probably the best part about working from home. I can spend a lot of time with my family on weekdays and weekends.


_在家工作的一个额外好处是能够花更多时间与家人在一起。例如，如果你休息，你可以去另一个房间和家人共度时光。当你在办公室工作时，你的家人不在你身边，所以你无法这样做。我喜欢在休息时和家人一起吃早饭或午饭。这可能是在家工作最好的部分。在工作日和周末，我可以和家人共度很多时间。_


Okay, now let's talk about the negatives of working from home. One bad thing is that it's easy to get distracted at home. For example, if you have young children at home with you, it can be hard to focus on your work. Children make noise and interrupt you while you're working. This is normal. So you have to learn to manage these situations and stay focused on your work.


_好的，现在我们来谈谈在家工作的缺点。一个不好的地方是在家容易分心。例如，如果你家里有年幼的孩子，那么专注于工作可能会很困难。孩子们会发出噪音并在你工作时打扰你。这是正常的。所以你必须学会管理这些情况，保持对工作的专注。_


Another negative thing about working from home is that, sometimes you don't know when to stop working. When you work at an office, you stop working when you leave the office, you know exactly when your workday is done. However, when you work from home, it can be hard to know when to stop each day. You don't have your boss there to tell you when to stop.


_在家工作的另一个不利之处是，有时候你不知道何时该停止工作。当你在办公室工作时，你离开办公室时就停止工作，你知道你的工作日何时结束。然而，当你在家工作时，很难知道每天何时该停下来。你没有老板在那里告诉你何时该停止。_


One more negative thing about working from home is not having contact with other people. In general, it's important to talk and interact with other people. If you work from home, you only talk to your coworkers on the computer or on the phone. This is okay, but I think it's also good to interact with people in person. It feels good to be around people and to work with people. So in general, I like working from home, but it's not perfect.


_在家工作的一个负面因素是缺乏与他人的接触。通常，与他人交谈和互动是很重要的。如果你在家工作，你只会在电脑上或电话上与同事交谈。这没问题，但我认为面对面与人互动也很好。在人群中感觉很好，与人们一起工作也很好。因此，总的来说，我喜欢在家工作，但它并不完美。_
