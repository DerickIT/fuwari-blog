Hello Derick,


Sure, here's your study plan for the sixth day of the first week:


### Day 6: Basic Adjectives and Descriptions


**Morning Session:**

- Start with a quick review of the alphabet, sounds, basic greetings, numbers, days of the week, common verbs, subjects, and basic questions from the previous days.
- Learn basic adjectives such as "big", "small", "happy", "sad", "good", and "bad". Practice pronouncing each word and writing it down.

**Afternoon Session:**

- Learn how to use these adjectives to describe things. For example, "The apple is big", "I am happy".
- Practice using these adjectives in sentences and questions. For example, "Is the apple big?", "Are you happy?".

**Evening Session:**

- Review the adjectives and sentences by quizzing yourself or using flashcards.
- Write down the adjectives and sentences in order and try to use them in a conversation.

### Verification of Learning Results:

- **Self-Recording**: Record yourself saying the adjectives and sentences to check your pronunciation.
- **Written Exercise**: Write down the adjectives and sentences from memory.
- **Practical Application**: Describe something around you using the adjectives you've learned.
