Absolutely, Derick. Here's a detailed study plan for the third day of this week:


**Morning Session: Vocabulary Building**

- Start with a review of the words you learned the previous day.
- Learn 10 new words related to work and technology. Use flashcards, language learning apps, or a dictionary to understand the meaning, pronunciation, and usage of each word.
- Write sentences using each new word to understand its context.

**Afternoon Session: Grammar - Past Simple Tense**

- Review the structure of the past simple tense.
- Practice making sentences using the past simple tense. Try to incorporate the new words you learned in the morning session.

**Evening Session: Listening and Speaking Practice**

- Listen to a simple English conversation or story. Try to identify the new words and the usage of the past simple tense.
- Practice speaking by retelling the story or conversation. Record your speech for self-assessment.

**End of Day Review**

- Review the day's learning. Write down any questions or difficulties you encountered.

Remember, consistency is key in language learning. Try to immerse yourself in the language as much as possible. Listen to English songs, watch English movies or shows, and try to think in English. This will help you become more familiar with the language and improve your fluency.
