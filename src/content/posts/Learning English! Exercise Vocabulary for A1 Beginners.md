_大家好，欢迎观看初级英语听力视频。你可以用这个视频练习英语听力和理解能力。在开始之前，记得点选、关注、一键三连。_


You ready? So today I'm gonna talk about exercise. This is an important topic because everybody should exercise. Exercising or working out is necessary for good health. Let's talk about some different types of exercise.


_准备好了吗？今天我想聊聊锻炼身体。这是个很重要的话题，因为每个人都应该保持锻炼。保持锻炼是健康的必要条件。让我们聊聊不同的锻炼方式。_


One popular type of exercise is running. I'm a terrible runner because I get really tired when I run, but I wanna improve my running. Some people like running short distances, and some people like running long distances. I'm pretty fast when I run short distances, but I'm slow when I run long distances. I need to train more.


_一种流行的锻炼方式是跑步。我不擅长跑步因为我一跑就喘，但我想多练习跑步。有些人喜欢短路，有些人喜欢长跑。跑步我可以跑得很快，但长跑我跑不了多快。我得多练习。_


Some people prefer running outside and other people run on the treadmill. A treadmill is a machine for running. I don't like running on the treadmill. I prefer running outside in nature. How about you? Do you prefer running outside or on the treadmill?


_有些人喜欢户外跑，有些人喜欢在跑步机上跑。我不喜欢在跑步机上跑。我喜欢在自然环境中跑。你呢？你喜欢在哪里跑步？_


Okay, another popular type of exercise is weightlifting. People lift weights to build muscle and get stronger. Most people go to the gym to lift weights. In the past, I went to the gym often to work out. I lifted weights every week at the gym. But now I don't go to the gym. I have some weights at home, so I can lift weights here, but I don't have a lot of equipment, so I can't do many exercises. Some people have their own mini gym in their garage.


_另一个流行的锻炼方式是举重。人们通过举重锻炼肌肉，让自己变得强壮。有些人去健身房锻炼。以前，我会在结束工作后去健身房，我每周会去健身房练习举重，但现在不去了。我家里有几个举重器械，所以我可以在家里锻炼，但我器械不多，所以只能做一些简单的锻炼。有些人家里车库有个简易的健身房。_


Weightlifting is hard because weights are heavy. If you're not strong, you can't lift a lot of weight. But if you start lifting weights, you can get stronger.


_举重很难因为杠铃很重。如果你不够强壮，你举不了多重，但如果你开始练习，你就会变得强壮。_


Alright, another popular type of exercise is playing sports. Playing sports is good exercise and it's fun. Some people don't need to run or lift weights because they already play sports. Playing sports is good for your health. When I was young, I played many sports. I was pretty healthy. Sometimes I played sports with my friends and other times I played by myself. What's your favorite sport?


_另一种流行的锻炼方式是玩竞技运动。竞技运动是很好的锻炼方式，同时还很好玩。有些人不需要刻意地锻炼，因为他们已经有足够的竞技运动。这样的运动对你的健康有益。我年轻时参与过很多运动，那时候我的身体很健康。有时候我和朋友们一起，有时候我自己玩。你最喜欢的运动是什么？_


Another popular type of exercise is hiking. This is one of my favorite activities. Hiking is a great way to exercise, because you don't need any equipment. It's free. Also, you can enjoy nature when you hike. If you live in a rural area, you probably have many places to hike. If you live in a big city, it's harder to find places to hike. I love hiking in the mountains, the forests, the deserts, and in the hills.


_另一个流行的运动是徒步。这是我喜欢的运动之一。徒步是运动的好方法，因为你不需要任何器械，很简单。在徒步的过程中你可以亲近大自然。如果你住在乡下，你可能有很多适合徒步的地方。如果你住在大城市，可能很难找到适合徒步的地方。我喜欢在山涧、森林、荒漠徒步。_


In the US, hiking is a very popular activity. People go hiking with their friends and sometimes with their dogs. In other countries, hiking isn't so popular. When I have the chance, I try to find new places to go hiking.


_在美国，徒步是很流行的运动项目。他们要么和朋友，要么和自己的宠物狗一起徒步。有些国家并不怎么流行徒步。如果有机会，我会尝试寻找新的徒步点。_


Okay, one more type of exercise is walking. This is the simplest form of exercise. You can walk anywhere. I try to walk every day if I can, because I really like walking. So overall, there are many different types of exercise. You should try to exercise every day if you can.


_还有一个运动方式是步行。这个很简单。你可以在任何地方步行。我尝试每天保持步行，因为我真的很喜欢步行。总的来说，有很多不同的运动方式。你应该尝试每天保持运动。_
