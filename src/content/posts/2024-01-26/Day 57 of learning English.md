Dear Derick,


On the fifth day of the ninth week, we will focus on improving your reading comprehension skills, particularly in the context of technology and software. Here's your plan for the day:


**Morning Session (1 hour):**

- Read an article about recent developments in software technology. You can find these on tech news websites or blogs. Try to choose an article that is at your current language level or slightly above to challenge yourself.
- As you read, highlight any unknown words or phrases. Try to understand them from the context first, then look them up in a dictionary if needed.

**Evening Session (30 minutes):**

- Write a brief summary of the article in English. This will help reinforce what you've learned and practice expressing ideas in your own words.
- Review the new words or phrases you encountered and add them to your vocabulary list.

**Verification of Study Results:**

- Send me the summary you've written. I will review it to ensure you've understood the main points and provide feedback or corrections if necessary.
- Also, share the new words or phrases you've learned. I can help explain any that you're having trouble with.

Reading comprehension is crucial for understanding written English, and practicing with real-world articles will help you become more comfortable with technical language. Remember, regular practice is key, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions.
