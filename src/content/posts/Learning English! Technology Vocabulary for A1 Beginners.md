You ready? So today, I'm going to talk about technology. This is a great topic because we all use technology every day. You're using technology to watch this video right now. So let's talk about some different kinds of technology today.


_准备好了吗？今天，我将谈论技术。这是一个很棒的话题，因为我们每个人每天都使用技术。你现在就在使用技术观看这个视频。那么，让我们今天讨论一些不同类型的技术吧。_


One really important type of technology is computer technology. Computers today are much different than computers from the past. 20 or 30 years ago, computers were really limited. They couldn't do the things that computers do today. In the past, they were also really big. But today, computers come in many different sizes. Computers today are fast, powerful, and easy to use.


_一种真正重要的技术是计算机技术。今天的计算机与过去相比有很大的不同。20或30年前，计算机的功能非常有限。它们不能做现在计算机能做的事情。过去，计算机体积也相当庞大。但今天，计算机有多种不同的尺寸。现在的计算机速度快、功能强大且易于使用。_


I remember when I first started using the computer, I was 6 years old. I liked playing computer games, but all of the games were very basic at that time. I still thought they were really fun. Today, computer games are very complex.


_我记得我六岁开始使用计算机时，我喜欢玩电脑游戏，但那时所有的游戏都非常基础。尽管如此，我仍然觉得它们非常有趣。如今，电脑游戏非常复杂。_


Alright, now let's talk about cell phones. When I was a kid, not many people had cell phones. Most people used landlines, which are phones inside your house. Nowadays, not many people have landlines. Everyone has cell phones now. I remember getting my first cell phone when I was 12 years old. I thought it was so cool. These days, phones are extremely important, because you can do almost anything on your phone.


_好的，现在我们来谈谈手机。我小时候，有手机的人并不多。大多数人使用的是有线电话，就是家里的那种电话。现在，拥有有线电话的人不多了。现在每个人都有手机。我记得我12岁的时候得到了我的第一部手机。我觉得它非常酷。如今，手机非常重要，因为你几乎可以在手机上做任何事情。_


But I think the most important technology today is the internet. Most people use the internet every day to do many things. People like me need the internet in order to work. If I don't have the internet, I can't work. We also use the internet to study, to shop, and to entertain ourselves. I can't imagine not having the internet. I use it for many hours every day. How about you? How many hours a day do you use the internet?


_但我认为今天最重要的技术是互联网。大多数人每天都会使用互联网来做许多事情。像我这样的人需要互联网才能工作。如果没有互联网，我就不能工作。我们还使用互联网来学习、购物和娱乐自己。我无法想象没有互联网的生活。我每天会使用它很多个小时。你呢？你每天使用互联网多少小时？_


Okay, now let's talk about technology of the past. For example, one really important invention was the motorized vehicle, or the car. Before cars, people traveled by horse, by foot, or in other ways. When the car was invented, people were able to travel more easily. Cars from the past looked very different from today's cars. I think old cars look pretty cool.


_现在让我们来谈谈过去的技术。例如，一个非常重要的发明是机动车辆，或者说是汽车。在汽车出现之前，人们通过骑马、步行或其他方式出行。当汽车被发明出来后，人们能够更轻松地旅行。过去的汽车看起来与今天的汽车非常不同。我认为老式汽车看起来相当酷。_


Another really important invention was electricity. Before electricity, people had to use candles and fire for light at night. At night, the cities were much darker than today. Nowadays, our cities have so much light at night. And of course, we use electricity for so many different things today. Sometimes the electricity goes out, and everything stops working. I hate when the electricity goes out.


_另一个非常重要的发明是电。在有电之前，人们晚上不得不使用蜡烛和火把来照明。那时候，城市的夜晚比现在要暗得多。如今，我们的城市在夜晚有如此多的光亮。当然，今天我们使用电来做许多不同的事情。有时候电力会中断，一切都停止工作。我讨厌电力中断的时候。_


One more important invention was the television. In the past, television was the greatest form of entertainment. Everyone sat down in the evenings and watched TV. Nowadays, more people watch TV shows on their computers, like on Netflix. Many young people prefer doing everything on their computer or cell phone.


_又一项重要的发明是电视。在过去，电视是娱乐的主要形式。每个人晚上都会坐下来看电视。现在，更多的人在电脑上观看电视节目，比如在Netflix上。许多年轻人更喜欢在电脑或手机上做任何事情。_
