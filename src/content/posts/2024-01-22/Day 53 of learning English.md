Dear Derick,


On the first day of the ninth week, we will focus on advanced vocabulary building, particularly in the context of technology and software. Here's the detailed plan:


**Morning Session (1 hour):**

- Learn new vocabulary related to technology and software. You can use resources like online dictionaries, language learning apps, or English language textbooks that focus on technical English.
- Use flashcards and spaced repetition software to aid memorization. This method involves reviewing the flashcards at increasing intervals, which helps to move the new words from your short-term memory to your long-term memory.

**Evening Session (30 minutes):**

- Write sentences using the new vocabulary. This will help you understand the context in which these words are used and will reinforce your memory of them. Try to write sentences that are relevant to your work or daily life to make the learning process more meaningful and practical.

**Verification of Study Results:**

- At the end of the day, send me the sentences you've written. I will provide feedback on your usage of the new vocabulary and correct any errors. This will ensure that you're using the new words correctly and effectively.

Remember, learning a new language is a gradual process, and it's important to review and practice regularly. Don't hesitate to ask if you have any questions or difficulties.
