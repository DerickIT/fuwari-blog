For the sixth day of the fifth week, we will focus on enhancing your listening skills and reviewing the content learned throughout the week.


## Saturday - Week 5


### Morning Session: Listening Practice

- **Objective**: Improve your listening comprehension skills.
- **Activity**: Listen to English podcasts or watch English videos on topics of your interest. Try to understand the content without using subtitles. Write down any new words or phrases you hear.
- **Outcome**: Be able to understand spoken English better and expand your vocabulary.

### Midday Session: Vocabulary and Grammar Review

- **Objective**: Review the vocabulary and grammar learned this week.
- **Activity**: Use flashcards to review the vocabulary. Practice forming sentences using the grammar points learned this week (past simple, past continuous, future simple, future continuous tenses, and modal verbs).
- **Outcome**: Reinforce the vocabulary and grammar learned this week.

### Afternoon Session: Reading Comprehension

- **Objective**: Practice reading comprehension with a focus on new vocabulary and grammar.
- **Activity**: Read a short article or story and identify the new vocabulary and instances of the grammar points learned this week.
- **Outcome**: Summarize the article and discuss the use of the grammar points.

### Evening Session: Speaking Practice

- **Objective**: Apply the learned vocabulary and grammar in speaking contexts.
- **Activity**: Have a conversation with me or another English speaker, trying to use the new vocabulary and grammar points.
- **Outcome**: Improve your speaking skills and gain confidence in using English in conversation.

### Verification of Study Results

- **Method**: We will have a conversation where you will use the vocabulary and grammar learned throughout the week. I will assess your ability to use the grammar points and provide feedback on your conversational skills.

This day's plan is designed to consolidate your learning from the week and to practice applying it in a way that mimics real-world use, preparing you for more natural and spontaneous English communication[1][2][3][4].
