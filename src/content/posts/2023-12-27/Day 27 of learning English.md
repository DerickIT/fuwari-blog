On the seventh day of the fourth week, your learning tasks should focus on review and self-assessment. Here's a specific plan for the day:


### Review

- Review all the vocabulary words you've learned this week. Practice their pronunciation and usage in sentences.
- Review the grammar topics you've focused on this week, particularly the present simple tense and the use of adverbs of frequency.

### Self-Assessment

- Test yourself on the vocabulary words you've learned. You can do this by creating flashcards with the word on one side and its meaning on the other, or by using a language learning app that includes vocabulary quizzes.
- Write sentences using the grammar and vocabulary you've learned. Check to make sure you're using the present simple tense and adverbs of frequency correctly.

### Practice

- Practice speaking English out loud, focusing on using the vocabulary and grammar you've learned this week. This could be through having a conversation with a language exchange partner, speaking to yourself, or repeating phrases from English media.

### Verification

- To verify your study results, you will be asked to use the vocabulary and grammar you've learned in conversation or written exchange. You should also be able to respond to questions and express your ideas using the present simple tense and adverbs of frequency[1][2].
