On the third day of Week 7, you should continue to build on your vocabulary and grammar skills. Here's a detailed plan:


## Vocabulary Learning

1. **Days of the Week**: Continue to practice the days of the week in English. You can use songs, games, and practice using them in sentences[3][4].
2. **Use Flashcards**: Continue to use flashcards to study and memorize new words. You can add words related to the days of the week and common phrases used with them[5].
3. **Word of the Day**: Continue with the "Word of the Day" series to learn new words[2].

## Grammar Learning

1. **Use Online Resources**: Continue to use online resources for grammar exercises and explanations. You can focus on sentence construction using the days of the week[1][2].
2. **Practice Writing**: Write sentences using the new vocabulary and grammar concepts you've learned. Try to use the days of the week in your sentences[1][2].

## Verification of Study Results

1. **Flashcard Tests**: After studying the flashcards, test your memory by going through the flashcards again and trying to recall the meanings of the words[5].
2. **Writing Assessment**: Assess your understanding of the new grammar concepts by checking if your sentences are grammatically correct.
3. **Conversation Practice**: Practice using the new vocabulary and grammar concepts in conversations about daily life. This can be done with a language exchange partner, a tutor, or even a language learning app.

On the third day of Week 7, you should focus on expanding your vocabulary with new words and phrases, as well as reinforcing your understanding of the days of the week. Here are some specific words and phrases to learn:


## Vocabulary Words

1. **Superfluous**: This word means unnecessary, especially through being more than enough. The word of the week from the YouTube video can be used in a sentence like "The report was filled with superfluous details that were not relevant to the conclusion."[2].
2. **Days of the Week**: Make sure you are comfortable with the names of the days of the week: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. Use them in sentences to plan your week or talk about your schedule[4].

## Phrases

1. "The meeting on **Tuesday** is superfluous since we already discussed everything via email."
2. "I find it superfluous to have a meeting every **Monday** when a simple memo could suffice."

## Grammar

1. **Using Days of the Week in Sentences**: Practice using the days of the week in context. For example, "I will go to the gym on **Wednesday** and **Friday**."
2. **Adjectives and Adverbs**: Use adjectives and adverbs to describe activities or things associated with specific days. For example, "I have a busy **Monday** ahead," or "She usually works late on **Thursdays**."

Remember to practice these words and phrases in writing and speaking. You can write sentences or short paragraphs using the new vocabulary and days of the week, and try to use them in conversations with others or in language learning apps. This will help you to memorize and understand how to use them correctly in context.
