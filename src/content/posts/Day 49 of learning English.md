On the fourth day of Week 8, you should focus on listening exercises to improve your comprehension and familiarize yourself with different accents and speaking styles. Here's a detailed plan:


**Listening Exercises**

- Select two English-language podcasts or videos related to software technology and daily life. Choose content that is slightly above your current level of understanding to challenge yourself.
- Listen to each podcast or video carefully, trying to understand as much as possible. Pause and replay sections if necessary.
- Write down any new vocabulary or phrases you hear and look up their meanings.

**Active Listening and Note-Taking**

- Practice active listening by summarizing the main points of what you've heard. This can be done either in writing or orally.
- Take detailed notes on key concepts, new terminology, and any questions that arise during your listening practice.

**Pronunciation Practice**

- Repeat after the speakers in the podcasts or videos to practice pronunciation. Focus on intonation, stress, and rhythm.
- Record yourself speaking some of the sentences or phrases you've heard. Compare your pronunciation to that of the native speakers.

**Review**

- Review the vocabulary you've learned over the past three days. Try to identify and understand these words in the context of what you've listened to.
- Use the new vocabulary in sentences to reinforce your understanding and memory.

**Verification**

- At the end of the day, summarize one of the podcasts or videos you listened to in English. This will help you to consolidate your learning and practice output, which is crucial for language acquisition.

By engaging in these activities, you will enhance your listening skills, expand your vocabulary, and improve your pronunciation, all of which are essential for achieving conversational fluency in English.
