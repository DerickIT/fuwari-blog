Sure, Derick. Here's your study plan for the fifth day of this week. This day, we'll focus on reinforcing your vocabulary and practicing the past continuous tense, and we'll introduce the future simple tense.


**Morning Session: Vocabulary Review**

- Review the words you learned over the past four days.
- Practice using these words in sentences and in conversation.

**Afternoon Session: Grammar - Future Simple Tense**

- Learn the structure of the future simple tense.
- Practice making sentences using the future simple tense, incorporating the words you've learned over the week.

**Evening Session: Listening and Speaking Practice**

- Listen to a simple English conversation or story. Try to identify the new words and the usage of the past continuous and future simple tenses.
- Practice speaking by retelling the story or conversation. Record your speech for self-assessment.

**End of Day Review**

- Review the day's learning. Write down any questions or difficulties you encountered.

Remember, practice is key when learning a new language. Try to use the new words and grammar rules in your daily life. You can also use language learning apps or websites for additional practice.
