Dear Derick,


On the third day of Week 6, to effectively learn vocabulary and grammar, you should incorporate the following strategies:


**Vocabulary Learning**

1. **Contextual Learning**: Put the new words you've learned into context. This could involve reading a passage, watching a video, or listening to a conversation where these words are used[5].
2. **Non-Linguistic Representation**: Create non-linguistic representations for the words you've learned. This could be through drawings, symbols, or even acting out the words to reinforce their meanings[2].
3. **Think-Pair-Shares**: Discuss the meanings of the words with a partner or in a study group. This allows for peer learning and can help clarify any misunderstandings about word usage[2].
4. **Sentence Writing**: Write sentences using the new vocabulary. This helps you practice grammar and understand how the words fit into the structure of a sentence[2].
5. **Review and Self-Assessment**: Review the words you've learned and assess your understanding. You can use self-assessment scales to gauge your comfort level with each word[2].

**Grammar Learning**

1. **Grammar Exercises**: Continue practicing the present perfect and past perfect tenses through exercises. This could include fill-in-the-blank activities or sentence transformation exercises[3].
2. **Practical Application**: Use the grammar points in speaking or writing. For example, describe past experiences using the present perfect tense and narrate past events using the past perfect tense[3].
3. **Review**: Review the grammar rules and structures you've learned. Revisit your notes and practice sentences to reinforce your understanding[3].

By combining these strategies, you will reinforce the vocabulary and grammar you've learned, making it easier to remember and use them correctly in conversation.


On the third day of Week 6, here are the new words and grammar points you should focus on:


**Vocabulary Learning**


Based on the vocabulary list provided in the search results[5], here are 20 new words you should learn:

1. Abstract
2. Comprehensive
3. Explicit
4. Implicit
5. Inherent
6. Insight
7. Predominant
8. Rational
9. Empirical
10. Hypothesis
11. Analogy
12. Anomaly
13. Anticipate
14. Complement
15. Contradict
16. Denote
17. Diminish
18. Evoke
19. Fluctuate
20. Inhibit

For each word, understand its meaning, pronunciation, and usage in a sentence. You can use the context clues provided in the sentences from the vocabulary list[5] to understand how each word is used.


**Grammar Learning**


On the third day, continue with the past perfect tense. This tense is used to describe an action that occurred and was completed in the past before another past action[2][3]. Practice constructing sentences using this tense, such as "I had studied English before I met Judy."


Also, introduce the future perfect tense. This tense is used to describe an action that will have been completed at some point in the future[2][3]. Practice constructing sentences using this tense, such as "I will have learned 60 new words by the end of this week."


Remember to review these words and the grammar point several times throughout the day to help you remember them.
