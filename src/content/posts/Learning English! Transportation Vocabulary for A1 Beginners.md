You ready? So today, I'm gonna talk about transportation. This is an important topic because we all use some kind of transportation in our lives. Let's talk about the different types of transportation.


_准备好了吗？今天我想聊聊交通工具。这是个很重要的话题，因为我们都要使用交通工具。让我们聊聊各种不同的交通工具。_


One popular type of transportation is the subway. In other countries, people also use the words "metro" or "underground." But in the US, we usually say "subway." Many big cities around the world have a subway system.


_一种流行的交通工具是地铁。有些国家人们也用 “metro” 和 "underground" 称呼地铁，但在美国，我们通常用 “subway”。世界上很多大城市都有地铁。_


In cities like Paris, London, and Tokyo, the subway system is amazing. The subways in these cities are very organized and efficient. However, many big cities in the US don't have good subway systems. Most people in the US drive cars, so they don't need to take the subway. In my hometown of San Diego, we don't have a subway system.


_巴黎、伦敦和东京都有很惊人的地铁系统。这些城市的地铁非常有条理和高效。然而，美国的许多大城市都没有良好的地铁系统。在美国，大多数人都开车，所以他们不需要坐地铁。在我的家乡圣地亚哥，我们没有地铁系统。_


I like taking the subway in other countries because it's easy. You can go anywhere in the city without a car. But in some cities, the subway stations are dirty and a little scary. You need to be careful when you take the subway.


_我喜欢在其他国家乘坐地铁，因为它很容易。你可以不开车去城市的任何地方。但有些城市，地铁站很脏，有点吓人。乘坐地铁时需要小心。_


Okay, another form of public transportation is taking the bus. Big cities have bus systems that help people move around. In some cities, buses are nice, clean, and safe. But in other cities, buses are old, dirty, and a little dangerous.


_另一种形式的公共交通是坐公交。大城市有公交系统，可以方便人们四处走劫。有些城市，公交车很舒适、干净、安全，但有些城市的公交车老旧、脏乱、还不安全。_


For example, in Mexico, most buses are old and uncomfortable. They can also be dangerous because many bus drivers drive really badly. They drive really fast, and they often have accidents. Most people don't like taking the bus, but sometimes they have to. In many cities, taking the bus is cheap. If you don't have a lot of money, the bus can be a good option.


_比如，墨西哥，大多数公交车很老旧也很不舒适。它们也可能很危险，因为司机开得很快，而且经常发生事故。大多数人不喜欢坐公交车，但有时他们没有办法，在很多城市，公交车很便宜，如果你没什么钱，坐公交车是个不错误的选择。_


Okay, now let's talk about taxis and Ubers. In the past, many people took taxis, but nowadays, many people use Uber. I love using Uber. I use it all the time. An Uber is cheaper than a taxi and it's usually safe. I always have good experiences using Uber. I've taken a few taxis before, but I didn't like it. Taxis are usually expensive. In some cities, Uber is illegal, so people can't use it. How about you? Do you use Uber in your city?


_好的，现在我们聊聊出租车和网约车。以前很多人打车，但现在大家都用网约车。我喜欢用网约车,经常用。网约车比出租便宜还安全。网约车的体验总是很好。我偶尔也打车，但不喜欢，出租车比较贵。有些城市网约车不合法，所以人们没办法用。你呢，你会用网约车吗？_


Okay, another common type of transportation is riding a bike. This is a great way to move around the city because it's free. Riding bikes is also a healthy activity. The problem is that it's dangerous. In some cities, the drivers are crazy. So it's dangerous to ride a bike in the street. In other cities, there are bike lanes in the street, so it's safer. But I think it's always a little dangerous to ride a bike in the city.


_另一个公共交通是骑自行车。这是很好的出行方式，因为不需要花钱。骑行对身体也有好处。问题是有点危险，有些城市的司机很疯狂，所以在街道上骑行有点危险。有些城市有专门的骑行车道所以很安全。但我总觉得有点危险。_


One more type of transportation is walking. This is my favorite type of transportation because it's easy, free, and fun. I love walking because I love being outside. I think everyone should try to walk more.


_另一种交通工具是步行。这是我最喜欢的方式因为简单免费还有趣。我喜欢步行，因为我喜欢外面。我觉得每个人都应该多走路。_
