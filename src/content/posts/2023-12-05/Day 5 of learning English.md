Hello Derick,


Sure, here's your study plan for the fifth day of the first week:


### Day 5: Basic Questions and Responses


**Morning Session:**

- Start with a quick review of the alphabet, sounds, basic greetings, numbers, days of the week, common verbs, and subjects from the previous days.
- Learn basic question words such as "who", "what", "where", "when", "why", and "how". Practice pronouncing each word and writing it down.

**Afternoon Session:**

- Learn how to form basic questions using the question words and verbs you've learned. For example, "What is your name?", "Where are you from?", "How are you?".
- Practice responding to these questions. For example, "My name is Derick", "I am from China", "I am good".

**Evening Session:**

- Review the question words, questions, and responses by quizzing yourself or using flashcards.
- Write down the questions and responses in order and try to use them in a conversation.

### Verification of Learning Results:

- **Self-Recording**: Record yourself asking and answering the questions to check your pronunciation.
- **Written Exercise**: Write down the questions and responses from memory.
- **Practical Application**: Have a simple conversation with me using the questions and responses you've learned.
