Effective study techniques for learning a new language include:

1. **Daily Study**: Consistency is key in language learning. Schedule daily study periods and stick to them[1].
2. **Active Practice**: Practice speaking and writing in the language regularly. This can be done through conversation practice, writing exercises, or even speaking to yourself[1][2].
3. **Immerse Yourself**: Try to make the language a part of your daily life. This could involve watching TV shows, listening to podcasts, or reading books in the language you're learning[2][3].
4. **Use Spaced Repetition**: This technique involves reviewing information at increasing intervals over time, which is particularly effective for vocabulary acquisition[2].
5. **Transcription Technique**: This involves listening to a piece of language and then writing down what you hear. It's a great way to improve your listening skills and understanding of the language[3].
6. **Rote Memorization**: This involves repeating information until it is memorized. It can be particularly useful for learning vocabulary and basic phrases[4].
7. **Peer-to-Peer Learning**: Practice with a partner or a language exchange group. This provides opportunities to use the language in a conversational context[4].
8. **Use Language Learning Apps**: Apps like Duolingo, Babbel, or Rosetta Stone can provide structured learning paths and interactive exercises[4].
9. **Set Clear Goals**: Having clear, achievable goals can help keep you motivated and give you a sense of progress[4].
10. **Listen Regularly**: Regular exposure to the language, especially through listening, can help improve your understanding and pronunciation[2][5].

Remember, everyone learns differently, so it's important to find the methods that work best for you.
