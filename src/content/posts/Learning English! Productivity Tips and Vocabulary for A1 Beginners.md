So today I'm gonna talk about productivity. This is a great topic to talk about, because everybody wants to be productive. What does productivity mean? If you're productive, it means you produce a lot. It means that you see good results from your effort or work.


_今天我要聊聊生产力。这是一个很棒的话题，因为每个人都想要高效。生产力意味着什么？如果你有生产力，意味着你产出很多。它意味着你从你的努力或工作中看到了良好的结果。_


So let's talk about some ways we can be productive.


_那么，让我们谈谈一些我们可以提高生产力的方法。_


The first way we can be productive is by waking up early. I know that many of you don't like this advice. Not many people like waking up early. I wake up pretty early, but it's not easy for me. I usually wake up at 6 am Every day. This is early, but some people wake up earlier than me, like at 5:00am. I wake up early so I can be more productive every day. My official work starts at 7:30am. But since I wake up at 6, I can do more things before I start working. For example, I read a little bit in the morning and I study languages. I usually read for about 15 minutes and I can study languages for about 50 minutes. If I don't do this in the morning, I might not have time to do it later. So, I do all this before my work starts. I'm pretty productive in the morning. How about you? Are you productive in the morning?


_我们提高效率的第一种方式是早起。我知道你们中的许多人不喜欢这个建议。没有多少人喜欢早起。我起床相当早，但对我来说并不容易。我通常每天早上6点起床。这已经很早了，但有些人比我起得更早，比如在早上5点。我早起是为了让我每天都能更有效率。我的正式工作从早上7点半开始。但由于我6点就起床了，所以在我开始工作之前，我可以完成更多的事情。例如，早上我会读一会儿书，学习语言。我通常会读大约15分钟，我可以学习语言大约50分钟。如果我早上不这样做，我可能稍后就没有时间做了。所以，我会在工作开始之前完成所有这些。我早上效率很高。你呢？你早上效率如何？_


Okay, another way we can be productive is by removing distractions. A distraction is something that doesn't let you focus on your work. For example, if you're trying to work and you hear dogs barking outside, that might make you lose focus. Some distractions are hard to remove, like your neighbor's dog, but other distractions are easy to remove. For instance, you can silence your cell phone. If you hear your phone vibrate or ring, you usually wanna look at your phone. When my phone vibrates, I sometimes get distracted. If you want to remove this distraction, you can put your phone on silent or on airplane mode. For some people, this is hard. Some people don't wanna ignore their phone calls and messages. They think that it's very important to check their phone. This might be true, but it's also important to finish your work. If you silence your phone, it can help you finish your work faster. So removing distractions like this can be very helpful.


_我们可以通过消除干扰来提高生产力。干扰是指那些让你无法专注于工作的事物。例如，如果你正在工作，听到外面狗叫，那可能会让你分心。有些干扰很难消除，比如邻居的狗，但其他干扰很容易消除。例如，你可以将手机调成静音。如果你听到手机震动或铃声，你通常会想要查看手机。当我的手机震动时，我有时会分心。如果你想消除这种干扰，你可以将手机调成静音或开启飞行模式。对某些人来说，这很难。有些人不想忽略他们的电话和消息。他们认为检查手机非常重要。这可能是真的，但完成你的工作也很重要。如果你将手机静音，它可以帮助您更快地完成工作。因此，消除这样的干扰可以非常有帮助。_


Okay, another way we can be more productive is by making sure that we're comfortable when we work. For example, if you're in an uncomfortable chair, or if you feel hot or cold, you might be less productive when you're working. In my case, I don't work well if my chair is uncomfortable. Usually my back hurts and I wanna change positions. So I need to sit in a comfortable chair when I work. Sometimes I sit on my couch when I work, because it's comfortable there. This helps me be more productive.


_好的，我们可以通过消除干扰来提高生产力。干扰是指那些让你无法专注于工作的事物。例如，如果你正在工作，听到外面狗叫，那可能会让你分心。有些干扰很难消除，比如邻居的狗，但其他干扰很容易消除。例如，你可以将手机调成静音。如果你听到手机震动或铃声，你通常会想要查看手机。当我的手机震动时，我有时会分心。如果你想消除这种干扰，你可以将手机调成静音或开启飞行模式。对某些人来说，这很难。有些人不想忽略他们的电话和消息。他们认为检查手机非常重要。这可能是真的，但完成你的工作也很重要。如果你将手机静音，它可以帮助您更快地完成工作。因此，消除这样的干扰可以非常有帮助。_


All right. One more way that we can be productive is by setting goals. In my opinion, this is the best way to be productive. If you set goals for yourself, you feel motivated to work, you wanna achieve your goals. I always set goals for myself to help me be productive. It's good to set short term and long term goals. A short term goal is a goal you wanna achieve soon. A long term goal is a goal you wanna achieve after a long time. You can set short term and long term goals to help you learn English. For example, maybe your short term goal is to watch all my A1 listening practice videos by next month. And maybe your long term goal can be to read a whole book in English by the end of the year.


_我们可以通过设定目标来提高生产力。在我看来，这是提高生产力的最好方法。如果你为自己设定了目标，你就会感到有动力去工作，你想要实现你的目标。我总是为自己设定目标来帮助我提高生产力。设定短期和长期目标都是很好的。短期目标是你想要很快实现的目标。长期目标是你想要在很长时间后实现的目标。你可以设定短期和长期目标来帮助你学习英语。例如，也许你的短期目标是在下个月之前观看完我所有的A1听力练习视频。也许你的长期目标是在年底之前读完一整本英文书。_


You can set many types of goals for yourself. I like to set daily goals too. This helps me be productive every day. For instance, each day my goal is to practice my listening in French for one hour. Every day, when I complete this hour, I feel great. I know that I accomplished my goal. Okay, I hope you can use these tips to help you be more productive.


_你可以为自己设定多种类型的目标。我也喜欢设定每日目标。这有助于我每天都保持高效。例如，我每天的目标是练习法语听力一小时。每天，当我完成这一小时时，我感到很棒。我知道我完成了我的目标。好吧，我希望你们可以使用这些建议来帮助你们提高效率。_
