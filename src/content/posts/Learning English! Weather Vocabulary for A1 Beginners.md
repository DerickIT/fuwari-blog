Hey everybody, welcome to this A1 English listening practice video. You can use this video to train your listening and comprehension as I speak. You ready?


_大家好啊，欢迎观看这个英语听力视频，你可以用这个视频练习英语听力和理解能力。准备好了吗？_


So today I'm going to talk about the weather. This is an important topic because everybody talks about the weather. If you are learning English, you need to know how to talk about the weather.


_那么，今天我想聊聊天气。这个主题很重要，因为每个人都会聊到天气。如果你想学好英语，那你需要知道如何用英语聊天气。_


So let's start with sunny weather. Sunny weather is my favorite type of weather. When it's sunny outside, I'm happy. For me, hot weather is better than cold weather. Some people don't like the heat, but I don't mind the heat. It can be uncomfortable, but for me, that's okay.


_我们从晴天开始。我最喜欢晴天，每当外面天气晴朗，我就很开心。对我来说，热天比冷天好。很多人不喜欢天热，这会让人不舒服，但我无所屌谓。_


Some places are too hot though. For example, the city of Las Vegas is really hot in the summer. I like hot weather, but not that hot. In really hot cities, you need to stay inside during the afternoon. In the US, most buildings in hot cities have air conditioning.


_有些地方特别的热。比如，拉斯维加斯的夏天。我是喜欢天气热一点，但不是那种热死人的天气。在那种巨热的城市，整个下午你都得待在室内。在美国，大多数建筑都有空调。_


Okay, now let's talk about cloudy days. I hate cloudy days when the sun is not shining, I feel a little sad because I love sunny days, but cloudy days are normal. Every city has cloudy days. Some cities are always cloudy, like London. I can't live in a cloudy city. I need sunshine. Do you like sunny or cloudy days more?


_让我们聊聊阴天。我讨厌看不到太阳的阴天，我会有点难受。但阴天也很正常，每个城市都会有阴天。有些城市老是阴天，比如伦敦。我没办法在老是阴天的城市生活。我需要阳光。你喜欢晴天还是阴天？_


Okay, now let's talk about rainy days. For me, rainy days are the worst. I love being outside. So this is why I don't like the rain. When it rains, I can't do anything outside. I have to stay indoors all day.


_现在我们聊聊雨天，对我来说，雨天是最糟糕的，因为我喜欢待在外面。只要一下雨，我在外面什么也做不了，只能傻乎乎地待在室内。_


Some people really like the rain. My wife likes the rain, but only when she's inside. She says that the sound of the rain is calming. I don't agree. I don't like the sound of the rain. It reminds me that I can't go outside. Of course, you can go outside when it's raining, but you need to take an umbrella. If you don't have an umbrella, you get wet. Sometimes it starts raining when I'm not home and I don't have an umbrella with me. This is the worst. I don't like getting wet.


_有些人喜欢雨天，我老婆就是，但仅限于她在室内。她说下雨的声音能让感受到平静。我不认同这样的说法。我不喜欢下雨的声音，这意味着我不能出门。当然，你可以出门，但你得带伞。如果不带会淋湿。有时候下雨我没有带伞，就很头疼。我不喜欢被雨淋湿。_


Also, when it rains, it can be dangerous to drive. Many people have car accidents when it rains. When the streets are wet, you need to drive slower. If you don't, you can have an accident. On rainy days, there are a lot of car accidents. I don't like driving in the rain.


_同时，下雨会让开车变得危险。很多人发生车祸都是因为下雨。当街道变得很湿，你得开得很慢。如果你非要装逼，你可能会出车祸。雨天会有很多车祸，我不喜欢在雨天开车。_


All right, now let's talk about windy days. Some cities have a lot of wind and this can be good or bad. If you live in a hot city, the wind can be good because it cools the city down. But if you live in a cold city, the wind can be bad because it makes it even colder. If the wind is really strong, it can cause problems. Sometimes trees fall down because of the strong wind. Usually, I prefer days that aren't windy.


_好的，现在我们聊聊大风天。有些城市经常刮风，风也有好有坏。如果你生活在一个 很热的城市，有风是好的，因为可以降温。但如果你生活在很冷的城市，风可能不好，因为会更冷。如果风特别大，那就要出问题了。有些树倒了就是因为风太大。通常情况下，我喜欢没有风的天气。_


Okay, lastly, let's talk about the snow. It doesn't snow in my city, so I don't see the snow often. Some years, my family goes to the mountains in the winter to ski and snowboard. I like the snow, but I don't want to live in a snowy city. It's too cold and life is more difficult in the snow.


_最后，让我们聊聊下雪天。我们这里不下雪，所以我很少能看到雪。有些年，我们全家人冬天去山上滑雪。我喜欢下雪，但我不需要生活在雪很大的城市。在这样的城市生活很冷，也很难。_


I have some students that live in really cold cities. During the winter, the temperature can be minus 20 or minus 30 degrees Celsius. For me, that's crazy. I don't like the cold.


_我有一些学生生活在很冷的城市，冬天时他们那边温度会降到零下20-30度。那对我来说太疯狂了。我受不了太冷的天。_


Another bad type of weather is stormy weather. In the US, we have some bad storms like hurricanes and tornadoes. I've never seen a storm like this before, but I've seen many thunderstorms. These storms are not that bad, but I don't like lightning. Lightning can be scary.


_另一个不好的天气是暴风雨，在美国，我们有一些严重的风暴，如飓风和龙卷风。我以前从未见过这样的风暴，但我见过很多雷暴。这些风暴还不错，但我不喜欢闪电。闪电有点吓人。_
