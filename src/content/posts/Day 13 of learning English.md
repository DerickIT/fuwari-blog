Sure, Derick. Here's your study plan for the sixth day of this week. This day, we'll focus on reviewing the week's learning and practicing conversation.


**Morning Session: Vocabulary and Grammar Review**

- Review the words and grammar rules you learned over the past five days.
- Practice using these words and grammar rules in sentences and in conversation.

**Afternoon Session: Listening and Speaking Practice**

- Listen to an English podcast or watch a video related to technology or daily life, paying attention to the usage of the past continuous and future simple tenses.
- Practice speaking by summarizing the content of the podcast or video, using the vocabulary and grammar structures you've learned over the week.

**Evening Session: Conversation Practice**

- Have a simple conversation with me about your daily life and work.
- I will assess your vocabulary usage, grammar, and fluency.

**End of Day Review**

- Review the day's learning. Write down any questions or difficulties you encountered.

Remember, practice is key when learning a new language. Try to use the new words and grammar rules in your daily life. You can also use language learning apps or websites for additional practice.
