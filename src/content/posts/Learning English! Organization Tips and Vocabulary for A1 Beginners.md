Hey English learners, welcome to this A1 English listening practice video. You can use this video to practice your listening and learn new words and phrases.


_大家好，欢迎观看初级英语听力视频，你可以用这个视频练习听力和新的单词和词组。_


Today we're gonna talk about being organized. This is an important topic. If we're organized, it makes our lives easier.


_今天，我们要讨论如何变得有条理。这是一个重要的话题。如果我们有条理，我们的生活就会更加轻松。_


Before we start, remember to download my free Listening Time podcast on Spotify, Apple Podcasts, or any other podcast app so you can practice your English. The link is in the description below.


_在开始之前，记得点赞、关注、评论一键三连。_


Okay, let's talk about being organized. You might wonder why this is important. Well, being organized helps us feel less stressed and more in control. Let's talk about a few ways we can be more organized.


_好的，我们来聊聊如何变得有条理。你可能想知道为什么这很重要。嗯，有条理有助于我们感到压力更小，更有掌控感。让我们聊聊几种能让我们变得更有条理的方法。_


First, it's helpful to make lists. Lists are like your map for the day. You can write down what you need to do, like chores or homework. This helps you remember everything and feel more organized. And it feels great to check things off your list when you're done with them. It's also important to set priorities. This means deciding what's most important and doing those things first.


_首先，制作清单很有帮助。清单就像是你一天的地图。你可以写下你需要做的事情，比如家务或作业。这有助于你记住所有事情并感觉更有条理。当你完成它们时，从清单上划掉它们的感觉很棒。同时，设定优先级也很重要。这意味着决定什么是最重要的，然后首先去做这些事情。_


So you can look at your list and see which tasks need to be prioritized. This helps you manage your time better and not feel overwhelmed.


_所以你可以查看你的清单，看看哪些任务需要优先处理。这有助于你更好地管理你的时间，不会感到不知所措。_


Keeping your room and your workspace tidy is important, too. Imagine trying to find something in a messy room — It's hard.


_保持你的房间和工作空间整洁也很重要。想象一下在一间乱糟糟的房间里找东西——这很难。_


Keeping your bedroom, your office and your desk tidy helps you find things more easily. It also helps you feel calmer and more focused.


_保持你的卧室、办公室和书桌整洁有助于你更容易找到东西。它也能让你感觉更平静、更专注。_


Another thing that can help you be organized is using a calendar. This can help you remember important dates, like birthdays and appointments. You can write these things on the calendar so that you don't forget. You can also use your calendar on your phone and set reminders there. This is a fantastic way to stay organized.


_另一件事可以帮助你保持有条理，那就是使用日历。这可以帮助你记住重要的日子，比如生日和约会。你可以在日历上写下这些事情，这样你就不会忘记。你也可以使用手机上的日历并在那里设置提醒。这是保持有条理的绝佳方式。_


And lastly, one other tip is to plan ahead. If you plan your next day or your next week, you'll know what to do on those days. If you don't have a plan, you might feel disorganized and you might not know what you need to do. So having a plan that you can follow can really help. So those are some easy ways to keep your life organized every day, making lists, setting priorities, keeping your space tidy, using a calendar, and planning ahead. If you do all of this, you might feel less stressed and more in control.


_最后，另一个建议是提前计划。如果你计划好第二天或下一周，你就会知道那些日子该做什么。如果你没有计划，你可能会感到无组织，你可能不知道你需要做什么。因此，有一个你可以遵循的计划真的可以提供帮助。所以，这些是保持你的生活每天有序的一些简单方法：制作清单，设定优先级，保持你的空间整洁，使用日历，提前计划。如果你做到所有这些，你可能会感觉压力更小，更有控制感。_


Let's review some of the words in this video that I used that might be new for you. The word "chores" refers to tasks that you do at home, like doing the laundry and cleaning the bathroom.


_让我们回顾一下这个视频中我使用的一些可能对你们来说是新词的词汇。“chores” 这个词指的是你在家里做的一些任务，比如洗衣服和清洁浴室。_


The phrase "check things off your list" means that you have a list of tasks to do, and when you finish them, you make a Mark like this on your list.


_"check things off your list" 这个短语意味着你有一张任务清单，当你完成它们时，你会在你的清单上做一个像这样的标记。_


When you feel "overwhelmed", this means that you feel bad because you can't handle something. It's too much for you.


_当你感到 “overwhelmed” 时，这意味着你因为无法处理某件事而感到糟糕。这对你来说太多了。_


The word "tidy" means organized and clean. You should try to keep your room tidy.


_“tidy” 这个词意味着整洁有序。你应该尽量保持你的房间整洁。_


And "messy" means the opposite. This means that things are disorganized and not clean.


_而 “messy” 意味着相反。这意味着事物是无组织的，不干净的。_
