Hello Derick,


Great job on completing Day 1! Now, let's move on to Day 2. Here's your plan:


### Day 2: Basic Greetings and Phrases


**Morning Session:**

- Start by reviewing the English alphabet and sounds you learned on Day 1.
- Next, learn basic English greetings such as "Hello", "Goodbye", "Thank you", and "Please". Practice saying these phrases out loud.

**Afternoon Session:**

- Continue practicing the basic greetings. Try to use them in a conversation, even if it's just with yourself.
- Start learning some common English phrases like "How are you?", "Nice to meet you", and "I'm sorry". Practice these phrases out loud as well.

**Evening Session:**

- Review the greetings and phrases you've learned today.
- Write them down in a notebook and try to memorize them.

### Verification of Learning Results:

- **Quiz**: At the end of the day, take a short quiz to test your knowledge of the greetings and phrases.
- **Pronunciation Check**: Record yourself saying the new words and phrases, and I will provide feedback.
- **Conversation**: Try to use the new greetings and phrases in a conversation with me.

Remember, repetition is key when learning a new language. Practice these phrases as much as you can throughout the day. Good luck!


### Day 2: Basic Greetings and Phrases


**Morning Session:**

- Review the English alphabet and sounds from Day 1 for about 15 minutes.
- Learn basic greetings: "Hello", "Goodbye", "Thank you", "Please", "Good morning", "Good afternoon", and "Good evening". Write them down and practice pronouncing them.

**Afternoon Session:**

- Practice using the greetings you've learned in different scenarios. For example, greeting someone in the morning with "Good morning" and saying "Thank you" when someone helps you.
- Learn how to introduce yourself with "My name is..." and ask someone's name with "What is your name?".

**Evening Session:**

- Review the greetings and introduction phrases by practicing them with a partner or recording yourself and listening back.
- Memorize the phrases by writing them out and using flashcards.

### Verification of Learning Results:

- **Self-Recording**: Record yourself saying the greetings and introduction phrases. Listen to the recordings to check your pronunciation.
- **Written Exercise**: Write down the greetings and phrases from memory.
- **Role-Playing**: Engage in a simple role-play where you greet me and introduce yourself, using the phrases you've learned.

Remember to practice these phrases throughout the day in real-life situations or by simulating conversations. Consistent practice is essential for retention and improving your confidence in using the language. Good luck with Day 2!
