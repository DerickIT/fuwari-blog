### Verification of Study Results

- **Method**: We will have a conversation where you will use the new vocabulary words in context and demonstrate your understanding of the past simple tense. I will provide feedback on your pronunciation, grammar, and comprehension.

Remember to take breaks between sessions to rest and process the information. Consistency and practice are crucial, so stick to the plan and reach out if you encounter any difficulties.
