So today I'm gonna talk about free time. This is a good topic because everyone enjoys having free time. I love having free time and you probably do too.


_今天我要谈谈空闲时间。这是一个好话题，因为每个人都喜欢有空闲时间。我喜欢有空闲时间，你大概也喜欢。_


So first, let's talk about how much free time people have. Most children have more free time than adults. When you're a kid, you don't have the responsibilities that an adult has. Adults have to work, pay the bills, and take care of their children. Kids usually don't have to do these things. Kids usually have to go to school and do homework. This can be difficult, but it's usually not that difficult. So children have more free time.


_首先，让我们来谈谈人们有多少空闲时间。大多数孩子比成年人有更多的空闲时间。当你是个孩子时，你没有成年人所承担的责任。成年人必须工作，支付账单，并照顾他们的孩子。孩子们通常不需要做这些事情。孩子们通常需要去上学和做家庭作业。这可能会有些困难，但通常并不那么困难。所以孩子们有更多的空闲时间。_


When I was a kid, I had a lot of free time. I got home from school around 2 or 3 pm, and after that, I played a lot on weekdays. From Monday to Friday, I probably had around four or five hours of free time each day. Sometimes I got bored because I had so much free time. But as I got older, I had more homework each year. So each year I had a little less free time. I didn't have too much homework, though. In the US, we don't get that much homework. In some other countries, children have a lot of homework.


_小时候，我有很多空闲时间。我大概下午两、三点放学回家，之后就是玩。从周一到周五，我每天大概有大约四到五个小时的自由时间。有时候我会因为空闲时间太多而感到无聊。但随着年龄的增长，我每年的作业也越来越多。所以，我每年的空闲时间都少一些。不过，我的作业并不算太多。在美国，我们不会有那么多作业。在一些其他国家，孩子们有很多作业。_


I'm glad that my school work wasn't very hard. On weekends, I had even more free time on Saturday and Sunday. I did many activities. Weekends were the best because I had all day to play and rest. I really liked weekends and I still do.


_我很高兴我的学校作业并不很难。在周末，我甚至在周六和周日有更多的空闲时间。我做了很多活动。周末是最好的，因为我有整天的时间来玩和休息。我真的很喜欢周末，现在依然如此。_


Now that I'm an adult, I don't have a lot of free time. I have to work and do many other things. I usually start working early, like at 7:00am or 7:30am. So I have to wake up around 6:00am. When I was a kid, I slept more. I usually slept for 8 hours every night. As an adult, I don't sleep 8 hours every night. I usually get seven hours or seven and a half hours of sleep. How about you? How many hours of sleep do you get? So after I finish work, I have some free time in the evening. However, I usually do some extra work or studying during this time. I have to make these YouTube videos and Instagram videos. And I also study foreign languages. At night, I have some free time to just relax. My wife and I spend the evenings together and enjoy this time.


_既然我已经成年了，我并没有太多的空闲时间。我必须工作，还得做许多其他事情。我通常很早就开始工作，比如早上7:00或7:30。所以我必须在早上6:00左右醒来。当我还是个孩子的时候，我睡得更多。我每晚通常睡8个小时。作为一个成年人，我每晚不睡8个小时。我通常睡七个小时或者七个半小时。你呢？你每晚睡几个小时？所以，当我完成工作后，晚上我有一些空闲时间。然而，我通常在这个时间做一些额外的工作或学习。我必须制作这些YouTube视频和Instagram视频。我也学习外语。晚上，我有一些空闲时间来放松。晚上，我和我的妻子一起度过，享受这段时间。_


Okay, now let's talk about some popular activities that people do in their free time. For example, many people like to play sports or exercise in their free time. When I was a kid, I played a lot of sports. I played basketball, baseball, tennis, soccer, football, and golf. I really liked playing sports in my free time. But as an adult, I don't play any sports. I'm not very interested in playing sports nowadays. However, I exercise in my free time. I work out almost every day, but just for a short time. Other people spend a lot of time exercising.


_好的，现在让我们谈谈人们在空闲时间做的一些流行活动。例如，许多人喜欢在空闲时间进行运动或锻炼。当我还是个孩子的时候，我玩了很多运动。我打篮球、棒球、网球、足球、美式足球和高尔夫球。我真的很喜欢在空闲时间活动。但作为一个成年人，我活动就少了。我现在对活动不是很感兴趣。不过，我在空闲时间锻炼。我几乎每天都健身，但只是很短的时间。其他人则花很多时间锻炼。_


So another activity that people do in their free time is watch TV shows and movies. Many people do this in their free time. I know some people who watch many hours of TV every day. I don't watch a lot of TV or movies. I really like playing games in my free time. I play chess online, but I'm not very good. I also like playing board games with my family. We play games like Katan and code names. Do you like playing board games?


_人们在空闲时间做的另一项活动是观看电视节目和电影。许多人在他们的空闲时间做这件事。我认识一些每天看很多小时电视的人。我不太看电视或电影。我非常喜欢在空闲时间玩游戏。我在线下棋，但我不太擅长。我也喜欢和家人一起玩桌游。我们玩像卡坦岛和代号这样的游戏。你喜欢玩桌游吗？_


One last activity that most people do in their free time is surf the internet. This is probably the most common activity that people do. I spend a lot of time on the internet. Some days I spend too much time on the internet. It's not good to spend all day inside on the computer. We should try to go outside and do other activities too. But the internet is very entertaining, so it's easy to spend many hours surfing the web.


_大多数人在空闲时间做的最后一项活动是上网冲浪。这可能是人们最常见的活动。我在网上花费了很多时间。有些日子我在网上花费的时间太多了。整天待在室内对着电脑不太好。我们应该尝试出去做其他活动。但互联网非常有趣，所以很容易在网上冲浪数小时。_
