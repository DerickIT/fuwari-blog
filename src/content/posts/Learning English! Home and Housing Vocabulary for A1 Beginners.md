You ready? So today I'm gonna talk about homes. This is an important topic because we talk about our homes a lot. Let's talk about the different types of homes.


准备好了吗？今天我想聊聊房子。这是个很重要的话题，因为我们经常聊关于房子的话题。我们来聊聊不同的房子。


Some people live in houses. Some people live in apartments, and other people live in other types of homes. Houses and apartments are the most common types of homes.


有些人住独栋的房子，有些人住公寓，还有些人住其他类型的房子。独栋房子（小别墅）和公寓是最常见的住宅。


In big cities, people often live in apartments. Apartments are very common in big cities. They're usually smaller and cheaper than houses. Some apartments are in really tall buildings. These buildings can have 20 or 30 floors sometimes. I don't wanna live on the 30th floor. I prefer living on the first or second floor. If you live outside the city, you probably live in a house, not an apartment.


在大城市，人们经常住公寓。公寓在大城市里很常见。它通常比独栋的房子小一点，便宜一点。有些公寓造得巨高，有时候有20层或30层高。我不喜欢住在30层高的房子里。我喜欢住1楼或2楼。如果你生活在主郊区，你大概率住在独栋的房子里。


People that live in the countryside usually live in houses. These houses are usually bigger than apartments. They also have backyards. A backyard is the place behind your house where you can have grass, trees, gardens, or a pool. When I was a kid, I loved playing in my backyard. It was fun to play outside every day. Most departments don't have backyards. They usually have balconies instead.


生活在乡下的人通常住在独栋房子里。这些房子通常比公寓大很多，这些房子有一个后院。你可以在后院种草、种树、种花或挖个泳池什么的。我小时候很喜欢在后院玩，每天都玩得很开心。大多数公寓没有后院，但通常会有阳台。


Okay, now let's talk about the price of houses and apartments in the US. Houses and apartments can be really expensive if you live in a big city. In my home state of California, houses and apartments cost a lot of money. The average price of a house in California is almost $600,000. Crazy. It's also really expensive to rent an apartment in California.


接下来，我们聊聊美国各种房子的价格。如果你生活在大城市，独栋房子和公寓都贵得要死。我的家乡加利福尼亚州，独栋房子和公寓要花费很多钱。独栋房子平均600000美元。要死了！租房子是贵得要死，简直没法活。


In the US, people usually rent apartments, but in some other countries, people often buy apartments. When I was younger, I shared an apartment with other roommates. It's common to have roommates in the US. Sometimes you have good roommates and sometimes you have bad roommates. Have you ever had roommates before?


在美国，人们通常租公寓，但在别的国家，人们经常买公寓。我年轻的时候和别人合租一套公寓，在美国合租很常见。有时候会遇到好的室友，有时会遇到烂室友。你有合租过吗？


Okay, now let's talk about other types of homes. Some people live in condos, which are similar to apartments. Single condos are part of a bigger building or complex, just like apartments. But in the US, many people buy condos, but they don't buy apartments.


现在我们聊聊其他类型的房子。有些人生活在商品房中，这种房子和公寓有点像。单人公寓是大型建筑或综合体的一部分，就像公寓一样。在美国，很多人买商品房，不买公寓。


One more type of home that exists in the US is the townhouse. Townhouses are similar to normal houses, but they're often smaller and cheaper. Also, they're usually part of a community of townhouses.


美国还有一些类型的房子叫 Townhouse （类似联排别墅）。Townhouse 和独栋房子类似，但相对便宜点，小一点。此外，它们通常是联排别墅社区的一部分。


So there are several different types of homes that people can buy or rent. Some people prefer houses, some people prefer apartments, and other people prefer condos or townhouses. I think I prefer houses. I hope I can buy a house in the future.


因此，人们可以购买或租用几种不同类型的房屋。不同人喜欢不同类型的房子。我更喜欢独栋房子，希望有生之年能买一个。
