You ready? So today, I'm gonna talk about money. This is a really important topic because money is a big part of our lives.


_准备好了吗？那么今天，我要谈谈金钱。这是一个非常重要的话题，因为金钱是我们生活中很大一部分。_


So first, let's talk about currencies. A currency is the type of money that a country uses. For example, the currency of the US is the dollar. And the currency of Mexico is the peso. Every country uses a currency to buy and sell things. Some currencies are very valuable, and other currencies are not very valuable. For example, today, one US dollar is worth 22 Mexican pesos. The dollar is more valuable right now. So, what currency does your country use?


_首先，我们来谈谈货币。货币是一个国家使用的钱的类型。例如，美国的货币是美元。墨西哥的货币是比索。每个国家都使用货币来买卖东西。有些货币非常有价值，而其他货币则不太有价值。例如，今天，一美元相当于22墨西哥比索。美元现在更有价值。那么，你们国家使用的是什么货币呢？_


Okay, now let's talk about prices. In the US, most things are expensive. They cost a lot of money. In other countries, things are cheap. They don't cost a lot of money. For instance, in the US, the average price of a house is about $250,000. But in Mexico, the average price of a house is probably around $40,000. That's a big difference. Prices are very different in different countries. Another major difference is with salaries. The salaries in some countries are high, and the salaries in other countries are low. In the US, salaries are pretty high. Americans need to make a lot of money because life is expensive in the US. In some countries, people don't need a lot of money to live, but everyone needs some money to survive.


_现在我们来谈谈价格。在美国，大多数东西都很贵。它们需要很多钱。在其他国家，东西便宜。它们不需要很多钱。例如，在美国，一套房子的平均价格大约是25万美元。但在墨西哥，一套房子的平均价格可能大约是4万美元。这是一个很大的差异。不同国家的价格差异非常大。另一个主要差异是工资。一些国家的工资很高，而其他国家的工资很低。在美国，工资相当高。美国人需要赚很多钱，因为在美国生活成本很高。在一些国家，人们不需要很多钱就能生活，但每个人都需要一些钱来生存。_


Okay, now let's talk about spending and saving money. Some people really like spending money, and other people prefer saving more money. Different people have different habits. My family always liked saving money. My mom taught me to always save some of my money. So today, I try to save some of the money I earn. It's not always easy to save, though. You have to be careful with your money because it's easy to spend too much.


_好的，现在让我们来谈谈花钱和存钱。有些人真的很喜欢花钱，而另一些人则更倾向于存更多的钱。不同的人有不同的习惯。我的家人总是喜欢存钱。我妈妈教我一定要存一部分钱。所以今天，我尽量存下我赚的一些钱。不过，存钱并不总是容易的。你必须小心你的钱，因为很容易就会花得太多。_


I know many people who don't save money. They always spend their money on clothes, electronics, vacations, and other things. I spend money on these things too, but not all my money. Some people spend all their money because they want to enjoy the moment. I don't think I could do this. I think it's good to enjoy the moment, but it's also good to plan for the future.


_我知道很多人不存钱。他们总是把钱花在衣服、电子产品、度假和其他东西上。我也在这些东西上花钱，但不是我所有的钱。有些人把所有的钱都花光，因为他们想要享受当下。我不认为我能做到这样。我认为享受当下是好的，但为未来做计划也是好的。_


One other thing that people do with their money is invest. You can invest in many different things like the stock market, real estate, currencies, or gold. Many Americans invest their money. They want to use this money to make more money in the future. In some countries, investing is not very popular, or sometimes they don't have good investment options. You need to be careful when you invest your money because not all investment options are good. Some investments are bad, and you can lose money. Overall, people have many different ways to manage their money.


_人们用钱做的另一件事是投资。你可以投资许多不同的东西，比如股票市场、房地产、货币或黄金。许多美国人会投资他们的钱。他们希望用这笔钱在未来赚更多的钱。在一些国家，投资并不十分流行，或者有时他们没有好的投资选择。你需要小心投资你的钱，因为并非所有投资选择都是好的。有些投资是坏的，你会赔钱。总的来说，人们有多种不同的方式来管理他们的钱。_
