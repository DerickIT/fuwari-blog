Dear Derick,


On the third day of your eleventh week, you should focus on improving your listening comprehension skills and writing in English. Here's your plan for the day:


### Wednesday:


### Morning:

- **Listening Practice:** Listen to English podcasts or watch videos on topics of personal interest. This will help you improve your comprehension and familiarize yourself with different accents and speaking speeds.
- **Note-Taking:** While listening, take notes on new vocabulary or phrases you come across. Try to understand them from the context or look them up later.

### Afternoon:

- **Writing Practice:** Write a short essay on a technological topic. This could be about a recent development in software technology, a review of a tech product, or a prediction about future tech trends.
- **Review and Feedback:** Submit your essay to me for review. I will provide feedback on your grammar, vocabulary usage, and overall structure.

### Verification of Study Results:

- **Listening Comprehension Quiz:** I may quiz you on the content of the podcasts or videos you listened to in the morning to assess your comprehension.
- **Writing Review:** We will go over the feedback on your essay together, discussing areas of improvement and strategies for enhancing your writing skills.

Remember, improving your listening and writing skills is crucial for achieving fluency in English. Make sure to practice these skills regularly and incorporate the feedback you receive into your future practice.


Best regards,
Professor Judy
