On the seventh day of Week 10 in the study plan, the tasks could include:

1. **Rest and Immersion**: Take this day to rest from active study and immerse yourself in the English language in a more relaxed way. This could involve watching English-language movies, listening to music, or reading for pleasure in English.
2. **Reflect on Learning**: Reflect on the progress you've made over the week. Consider what has been effective and what might need more attention or a different approach.
3. **Prepare for Upcoming Week**: Look ahead to Week 11. Start to think about the topics and materials you will cover. Gather resources and set goals for what you want to achieve.
4. **Casual Practice**: If you feel inclined, engage in casual English practice by chatting with friends, posting on social media in English, or writing in a journal.

This day should be less structured, allowing for rest and consolidation of the learning from the week, while still engaging with the language in a stress-free way.
