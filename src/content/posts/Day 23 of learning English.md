On the third day of the fourth week, your learning tasks should focus on listening comprehension and continue practicing the present simple tense. Here's a specific plan for the day:


### Listening Comprehension

- Listen to English podcasts or watch videos related to software technology. This will help you get used to the rhythm and pronunciation of English speech, and also familiarize you with technical jargon in context.
- Try to understand the main ideas and details of what you listen to. Write down new words and phrases, and look up their meanings.

### Vocabulary

- Review the 40 words you've learned in the past two days. Practice their pronunciation and usage in sentences.

### Grammar

- Continue practicing the present simple tense, focusing on forming negative sentences and questions. Also, start learning about adverbs of frequency (always, usually, often, sometimes, rarely, never) and their placement in sentences.
    - Example: "He usually codes in the morning." "Does she often debug the software?"

### Practice

- Create sentences using the vocabulary you've learned, incorporating adverbs of frequency and the present simple tense.
- Try to listen to and repeat sentences from the podcasts or videos you've listened to. This will help improve your pronunciation and intonation.

### Verification

- To verify your study results, you will be asked to use the vocabulary and grammar you've learned in conversation or written exchange. You should also be able to summarize the main ideas of the podcasts or videos you've listened to.
