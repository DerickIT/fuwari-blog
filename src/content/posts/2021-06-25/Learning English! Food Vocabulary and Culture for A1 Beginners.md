Hey everybody, welcome to this A1 English listening practice video. You can use this video to train your listening and comprehension as I speak. You ready?


_兄弟们好，欢迎观看 A1 级别的英语听力视频。你可以用这个视频来练习英语听力和理解能力。准备好了吗？_


So today I'm going to talk about cooking. I do not know how to cook, so I do not know a lot about this topic. However, I like eating, so I like talking about food in general.


_今天，我想聊聊做饭。我不会做饭，我不太了解这个话题。不过，我是个吃货，所以我可以聊聊常见的食物。_


I am lucky because my wife cooks very well. She has a natural talent for cooking. So she cooks well. That means that I eat well. Let me tell you about some of the things that my wife cooks.


_我很幸运有一个会做饭的老婆。她很有做饭的天赋，这就意味着我吃得很好。我们聊聊我老婆做的一些食物。_


Since she is Mexican, she likes cooking Mexican food. Sometimes she makes tacos, which are delicious. There are many types of tacos. So my wife can cook different tacos each time. I also cooked tacos in the past, but I don't cook well, so my tacos weren't very good. I cooked "tacos de lengua", tongue tacos, but I didn't cook them very well. My wife cooks much better.


_她很喜欢做墨西哥菜，因为她是墨西哥人。有时候她会做 tacos ，好吃极了。tacos 有很多种类型，我老婆每次都会做不同的。我以前也做过，但做得不好。我做过一些名字奇奇怪怪的 tacos，但做得不好。我老婆做得好。_


The only thing that I cook well is eggs. I love eggs and I eat them almost every morning. I think eggs are the best breakfast food. I usually eat scrambled eggs, but I also eat other types of eggs, too. My favorite type is eggs Benedict. This is my favorite breakfast. Have you tried eggs Benedict?


_我唯一能做好的就是鸡蛋。我喜欢吃鸡蛋，每天早上都吃。我认为鸡蛋是最好的早餐。我喜欢吃炒鸡蛋，也喜欢吃其他类型的，最喜欢的是火腿鸡蛋饼。那是我最喜欢的早餐，你要不要试试？_


So my wife also makes pasta. She makes really good pasta. She doesn't buy the pasta in the box that you buy from the store. She makes the pasta by hand. She makes the noodles and they taste so good. When you make pasta by hand, it tastes better. I love all types of pasta, but my favorite is ravioli. For me, ravioli is the perfect food. Actually, I like all Italian food. When we were in Italy, we ate some amazing food.


_我老婆也会做意大利面，做得很好吃。她不从商店购买已经包装好的意大利面，她自己亲手做。她自己做的面好吃极了。你自己亲手做的面一定好吃。我喜欢各种意大利面，但最喜欢的是 ravioli。对我来说 ravioli 是最棒的食物，其实我喜欢所有意大利食物。我在意大利时吃了很多很棒的食物。_


My wife also cooks a lot of meat. We like eating different cuts of steak every week. We try to buy cheap meat because meat can be expensive. We don't want to spend a lot of money, so we buy cheap meat.


_我老婆也做过很多肉，我们喜欢每周吃点不同的牛肉。我们尽量买便宜点的肉，因为肉很贵。我们不想花太多的钱，所以买便宜点的肉。_


My wife cooks the meat in a pan, which is easy. Other people cook their meat on a grill. We don't have a grill, so we use a pan. I think that meat tastes good if it's cooked on a pan or on a grill. Meat is always good. I hope my wife cooks meat tonight.


_我老婆用平底锅做肉，这很方便，也有人用烤架。我们没有烤架，所以用平底锅。我觉得用烤架和平底锅做的肉都很好吃。肉总是好的，我希望我老婆今晚做做点肉吃。_


She also cooks really good breakfast. She makes really good pancakes. I like to eat pancakes with maple syrup and peanut butter. I know that's a little strange, but it's delicious. I love pancakes and peanut butter.


_她做早餐也是一绝。她煎的饼超好吃。我喜欢在煎饼上放枫糖浆和花生酱。我知道这听起来有点奇怪，但真的很好吃。我喜欢煎饼和花生酱。_


My wife also cooks chilaquiles, a common Mexican breakfast. This is my favorite breakfast in the world. I love chilaquiles. This dish has tortilla chips, salsa, cheese and cream. I like it with eggs on top. It's so good.


_我老婆也会做 chilaquiles (一种煎饼)，一种常见的墨西哥早餐。这是我最喜欢的早餐（放屁，他上面说最喜欢的早餐是鸡蛋）。我喜欢吃 chilaquiles。这道菜有玉米片、莎莎酱、奶酪和奶油。我喜欢上面有鸡蛋，简直了都。_


I don't know which is better, breakfast or dinner. In my family, we cook dinner five days a week. The other days we go out to eat dinner or we eat dinner with other people. Sometimes we eat dinner with my parents and other times we eat dinner with my sister. Tonight we will eat dinner with my parents and my mother will cook dinner. When I was a kid, my mother cooked dinner every weekday, every evening. We ate dinner at 6:30pm every day. Do you eat dinner at the same time every day?


_我不知道早餐和晚餐哪个更好。在我们家，我们每周做五次晚饭。其他几天我们出去吃或和其他人一起吃。有时候和父母一起吃，有时候和姐妹一起吃。今晚我们和父母一起吃，我老娘亲自下厨。我小时候，我老娘每个工作日都自己做晚饭。我们一般每天六点半吃晚饭。你们呢？_


In the US, it's common for families to eat dinner together. We sit together at the table, we eat and we talk about our day. Dinner time is important in the US. In other countries, people eat dinner late, like at 8pm or 9pm. But this is too late for me. I don't want to eat dinner late. I like eating dinner at 5, 6 or 7pm. This is a good time for dinner.


_在美国，一家人一起吃晚饭是很普遍的。我们围坐在桌子前，一起吃饭，一起聊今天过得怎么样。晚饭对于美国家庭来说很重要。有些国家，晚饭吃得很晚，可能8-9点。这对我来说太晚了。我不想吃得太晚。我喜欢5-6点左右吃。这是晚饭的最佳时间。_


What do you like eating for dinner? I like every type of food from every country. I can eat anything. And I love trying new foods. Like I said, I don't cook well, but I eat well. Maybe I will learn to cook in the future, but I don't know. I don't like cooking and I don't have the natural talent to cook. I prefer eating, not cooking. My wife cooks very well, so I don't need to learn. I'm thankful for that.


_你晚饭喜欢吃什么？我什么都吃，不管哪个国家的食物。我喜欢尝试新的食物。就像我说的，我不会做，但我能吃啊。也许我该学做饭，但怎么说呢，我不喜欢做饭，我也没有做饭的天赋。我就好吃。我老婆擅长做饭，我不需要学，我太幸运了，感谢老婆和上帝。_
