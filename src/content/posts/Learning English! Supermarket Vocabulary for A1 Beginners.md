So today, I'm going to talk about the supermarket. This is a useful topic because most people buy food from supermarkets. One important note: in the US, many people use the phrase "grocery store" instead of "supermarket." I usually say "grocery store," but you can use both.


_今天，我想聊聊超市。这是个很有用的主题，因为大家都去超市购买食物。有一点要说明一下，很多美国人用 "grocery store" 代替 "supermarket"。我一般也说 "grocery store"，但你都可以说。_


So first, let's talk about big supermarkets. The most famous supermarket is Walmart. Walmart is really big and sells many items. They sell food, clothes, electronics, furniture, and much more. Walmart has everything. In big supermarkets, there are a lot of cheap items. Personally, I don't like big supermarkets. I prefer smaller supermarkets because they often have better products.


_首先，让我们聊聊大型超市。沃尔玛是最牛逼的大型超市。它真的很大什么都卖。食物、衣服、电子产品、家具等，什么都有。大型超市有很多便宜的商品。老实说，我不喜欢大型超市，我喜欢小超市因为那里有更好的商品。_


I like to buy organic food, so I search for small organic stores. These stores are usually more expensive than big supermarkets. Organic food is more expensive than non-organic food, but I think it's worth the price.


_我喜欢有机食物，所以我会找一些小的有机商品店。这些超市一般会比大型超市贵，有机食物比普通食物贵，但我觉得这个钱值得花。_


In big supermarkets, I can't find the products I like. That's why I go to small local stores. There are also some very small supermarkets, too. We call these "convenience stores." For example, 7-11 is a convenience store. These stores sell some food and drinks, but they don't have a lot of items. I go to convenience stores when I need to buy just one or two items, but I don't usually shop at convenience stores. They don't have all the items that I need.


_我喜欢去本地小超市购物，因为大超市找不到想要的商品。有一些很小的商店我们称之为 “便利店”。比如：十足就是便利店。这些店卖一些食物和饮料，但它们的商品不多。当我只想买一两个东西时会去便利店，但我不经常在便利店消费。那里没有我想要的所有商品。_


How about you? Do you prefer big supermarkets, small supermarkets, or convenience stores? Some people don't go to supermarkets. They buy their groceries online. Nowadays, you can buy everything online. You order it, and someone brings it to your house. This is becoming a popular option. I order some items online, but I don't order food online.


_你呢？你喜欢去哪种商店购物？有些人不去实体店购物，他们在线上买东西。如今，你可以在线上买到任何东西，你在线上下单，有人给你送到家。这已经变成了很流行的购物方式。我也会在线上买一些东西，但不会买食物。_


Okay, now let's learn some important supermarket vocabulary. Our first vocabulary word is "cart." When you enter a grocery store, you grab a cart. You put all of your items in your cart while you're shopping. Or if you're only buying a few items, you can use a basket, which you carry.


_现在，我们聊聊关于超市的词汇。第一个是 "cart"，当你进入一家杂货店时，你拿一辆购物车。你在购物时把所有商品都放进你的购物车。或者如果你只买几样东西，你可以使用一个篮子，你带着它。_


Our next word is "aisles." Aisles are the rows of products in a store. You walk up and down the aisles when you go shopping.


_我们的下一个词汇是 "aisles" 。过道是商店里产品排列成的行。当你去购物时，你会在过道里来回走动。_


The next phrase is "on sale." When an item is on sale, this means that it has a lower price than normal. I love when items are on sale.


_下一句是 “on sale”。当一个商品打折时，这意味着它的价格比正常价格低。我喜欢商品打折的时候。_


Okay, one more word: "cashier." The cashier is the person that you pay when you're done shopping. In the US, cashiers are usually friendly. Nowadays, in some supermarkets, you can pay without a cashier. This is called "self-checkout." Some people prefer cashiers, and other people prefer the self-checkout option. I like both options.


_好的，再来说一个词：“收银员”。收银员是你购物结束后要付款给的人。在美国，收银员通常都很友好。现在，在一些超市里，你可以不用收银员就完成支付。这叫做“自助结账”。有些人更喜欢收银员，而有些人则更喜欢自助结账的选项。我两种选择都喜欢。_
