For the fifth day of the fifth week, let's focus on integrating the vocabulary and grammar you've learned so far with practical application exercises to enhance your conversational skills.


## Friday - Week 5


### Morning Session: Review and Vocabulary Integration

- **Outcome**: Be able to use the vocabulary in context, forming sentences that could be used in real-life situations.

### Midday Session: Grammar Focus - Modal Verbs

- **Activity**: Complete exercises from an English grammar workbook or online resource, focusing on modal verbs.
- **Outcome**: Be able to use modal verbs correctly in sentences to express different nuances.

### Afternoon Session: Practical Application - Role Play

### Verification of Study Results

- **Method**: We will have a conversation where you will use the vocabulary and grammar learned throughout the week. I will assess your ability to use modal verbs and provide feedback on your conversational skills.

This day's plan is designed to consolidate your learning from the week and to practice applying it in a way that mimics real-world use, preparing you for more natural and spontaneous English communication[1][2][3][4].
