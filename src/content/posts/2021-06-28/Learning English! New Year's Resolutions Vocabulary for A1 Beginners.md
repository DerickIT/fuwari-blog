Hey everybody, welcome to this A1 English listening practice video. You can use this video to practice your listening and comprehension as I speak. You ready?


_大家好，欢迎观看初级英语听力视频。你可以用这个视频练习英语听力和理解能力。准备好了吗？_


So today, I'm going to talk about New Year's resolutions. What is a New Year's resolution? This is a goal or an objective that you have for the next year. When it's the end of the year; some people make New Year's resolutions. They want to have a good year and do many things. Let's talk about some common resolutions.


_今天我想聊聊新年目标。什么是新目标？就是计划下一年的目标或项目。年底时，很多人会定新年目标。他们希望度过美好的一年，希望能做很多事情。让我们聊聊一些常见的新年目标。_


One common New Year's resolution is to lose weight. Many people plan to lose weight during the New Year. This is a good resolution. It can help you be healthy. It's not easy to lose weight, though. It can be difficult. You need to eat healthy food, and you need to exercise. Many people go to the gym in January because their New Year's resolution is to lose weight. But not everyone reaches their goal. Many people quit.


_其中一个常见的新年目标就是减肥。很多人计划在新的一年中减肥成功。这是个好目标，它可以让人更健康，尽管这很不容易。你喜欢吃得更健康，保持运动。很多人在一月份选择去健身房，因为他们决定减肥。但不是每个人都能实现，很多人中途放弃了。_


Okay, another common New Year's resolution is to study English more. This is a good New Year's resolution. Some people want to learn English to help their career. If you speak English, you can have better opportunities. For some jobs, you need to speak English. And for other jobs, you need to read and write in English. English is important for many jobs. Maybe English will help your career too. This year, my goal is also to study more languages.


_另一个常见的新年目标是学英语。这是个好目标。很多人想通过学习英语来提高职业竞争力。如果你会英语，那你就有更多的机会。有些工作需要说英语，有些需要能看懂或能用英语写作。对很多人来说英语很重要。也许英语会对你的职业生涯有帮助。今年我的目标是学习更多语言_


Alright, another common New Year's resolution is to read more books. Some people are very busy, so they don't read a lot. Other people are not good at reading, but they want to improve. And some people don't like reading, but they need to read. Many people have the New Year's resolution to read more. I think that's good. I want to read more, too. I want to read many books this year. How many books do you want to read this year? Maybe you can read books in English this year. That's a good resolution.


_另一个常见的新年目标是读书。有些人很忙没时间读书。有些人不擅长阅读，但想通过阅读提升自己。还有些人不需要阅读，但他们需要阅读。很多人的新年目标是多读书。我认为这很好，我也想多读点书。你新年打算读多少书？也许你今年可以选择阅读英语书。这是个好目标。_


Okay, another common New Year's resolution is to learn a new activity. This is a fun one. There are many activities that you can learn. Some people learn a new sport. Other people learn a skill. It's good to learn new things. Maybe you can take a class to learn something new. There are many classes that teach you different skills. You can look for classes in your city.


_另一个新年目标是学一门新的活动。这很有意思。有很多技能可以学。有些人选择一项运动。另一些人选择学一项技能。学习新东西是好事。也许你可以去报个班学一些新东西。有很多课程教你学不同的东西。你可以在你所在的城市找找。_


Another common New Year's resolution is to quit smoking. This is not a fun resolution, but it's good. I don't smoke, so I don't need to quit. But I could stop other bad habits. For example, I eat a lot of sugar. So maybe I should eat less sugar this year. Or maybe I should eat more vegetables.


_另一个新年目标是戒烟。这不是个有趣的目标，但很好。我不抽烟，所以不需要戒烟。但我可以戒掉其他的坏习惯。比如，我吃太多的糖。也许今年我该少吃点。或者我应该吃更多的可蔬菜。_


These are good resolutions. There are many different New Year's resolutions. I think this is good because people want to accomplish goals. It's good to accomplish goals. Okay, that's all for today. Leave a comment and tell me if you have a resolution for this year. I'll see you next time.
