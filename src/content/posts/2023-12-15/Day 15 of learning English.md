### **Grammar:**


Today's grammar focus is on the simple present tense for regular verbs. Here are the rules:

- For most verbs, add an 's' to the base form of the verb for third-person singular subjects (he, she, it). For example, "He works in a software company."
- For verbs ending in 'y' preceded by a consonant, change the 'y' to 'i' and add 'es'. For example, "She studies computer science."
- For verbs ending in 'o', 'ss', 'sh', 'ch', 'x', or 'z', add 'es'. For example, "He fixes bugs."
- The negative form is made by adding 'do not' or 'does not' before the base form of the verb. For example, "They do not update the software regularly."

For grammar, here are some examples using the simple present tense:

- Affirmative: "He updates the software regularly."
- Negative: "She does not ignore security warnings on her computer."

Remember to practice these sentences and try to create your own using the same vocabulary and grammar.
