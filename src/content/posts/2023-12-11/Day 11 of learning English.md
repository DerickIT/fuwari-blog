Sure, Derick. Here's your study plan for the fourth day of this week. This day, we'll focus on further expanding your vocabulary and introducing the past continuous tense.


**Morning Session: Vocabulary Building**

- Review the words you learned the previous day.
- Learn 10 new words related to travel and transportation.
- Practice using these words in sentences.

**Afternoon Session: Grammar - Past Continuous Tense**

- Learn the structure of the past continuous tense.
- Practice making sentences using the past continuous tense, incorporating the new words you learned in the morning session.

**Evening Session: Listening and Speaking Practice**

- Listen to a simple English conversation or story. Try to identify the new words and the usage of the past continuous tense.
- Practice speaking by retelling the story or conversation. Record your speech for self-assessment.

**End of Day Review**

- Review the day's learning. Write down any questions or difficulties you encountered.

Remember, practice is key when learning a new language. Try to use the new words and grammar rules in your daily life. You can also use language learning apps or websites for additional practice.
