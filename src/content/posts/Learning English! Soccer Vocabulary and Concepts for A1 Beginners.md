You ready? So today I'm gonna talk about soccer. This is a really popular topic because many people love soccer. Soccer is the most popular sport in the world. It's the most important sport in the world.


准备好了吗？所以今天我要聊聊足球。这是一个非常热门的话题，因为很多人都喜欢足球。足球是世界上最受欢迎的运动。它是世界上最重要的运动。


Let's talk first about the rules of soccer. The objective of the game is to score more goals than the other team. If your team scores more goals than the other team, your team wins and the other team loses. But it's not easy to score goals. It's hard. Each team has defenders who try to stop you from scoring goals. Midfielders are the players that play in the middle of the field. They have to run a lot. I never liked being a midfielder, because I can't run a lot. The players that usually score goals are called forwards. Being a forward is fun because scoring goals is fun. Also, each team has a goalkeeper. The goalkeeper can use his hands and his whole body to defend the goal. In total, each team has 11 players on the field.


我们首先来聊聊足球的规则。比赛的目的是比对方球队进更多的球。如果你的球队比对方球队进更多的球，你的球队就赢了，对方球队就输了。但是进球并不容易。这很难。每个球队都有防守队员，他们试图阻止你进球。中场球员是那些在场地中间踢球的球员。他们必须跑很多。我从来不喜欢当中场球员，因为我不能跑很多。通常进球的球员被称为前锋。当前锋很有趣，因为进球很有趣。此外，每个球队都有一个守门员。守门员可以用他的手和整个身体来防守球门。总共，每个球队在场上有11名球员。


Now let's talk about soccer's popularity. In most countries, soccer is the biggest sport. Most cities have a local soccer team, and the people support their city's team. There are also national teams every four years, national teams compete for the World Cup. During this time, everyone supports their country's team. Some nations are very good, like Germany, France, and Brazil. Other nations are not so good. The US doesn't have a very good team because soccer is not very popular in the US; most Americans prefer other sports like American football, basketball, and baseball. Many children play soccer in the US, but not many people enjoy watching soccer. I played soccer when I was a child and it was fun for me. I liked being a forward because I wanted to score goals. I don't play soccer now though.


现在让我们来聊聊足球的普及。在大多数国家，足球是最大的运动。大多数城市都有一支当地的足球队，人们支持他们城市的球队。每四年，每个国家的队伍还会组成国家队，国家队会为世界杯而竞争。在这段时间里，每个人都会支持他们国家的球队。有些国家非常出色，比如德国、法国和巴西。其他国家则不那么出色。美国并没有一个非常出色的球队，因为足球在美国并不十分流行；大多数美国人更喜欢其他运动，比如美式足球、篮球和棒球。在美国，许多孩子踢足球，但并没有很多人喜欢看足球比赛。当我还是个孩子的时候，我踢过足球，我觉得很有趣。我喜欢担任前锋，因为我想进球。不过，我现在不踢足球了。


Okay, lastly, let's talk about soccer leagues around the world. Most countries have a domestic soccer league with local teams. Some famous soccer leagues include the English Premier League, La Liga in Spain, Bundesliga in Germany, and Serie A in Italy. These leagues have some very good teams; some of the best teams in the world include Real Madrid, Barcelona, Liverpool, Bayern Munich, and Juventus.


好的，最后，让我们聊聊世界各地的足球联赛。大多数国家都有本国的足球联赛和当地球队。一些著名的足球联赛包括英格兰足球超级联赛、西班牙的西甲联赛、德国的德甲联赛和意大利的意甲联赛。这些联赛中有一些非常优秀的球队；世界上最好的球队包括皇家马德里、巴塞罗那、利物浦、拜仁慕尼黑和尤文图斯。


In the past, I really liked watching Cristiano Ronaldo play. I watched him play for Real Madrid, Juventus, and Portugal. My favorite matches are the Champions League matches. The Champions League is the highest competition for European teams. Every year in the Champions League, the best teams in the world play against each other. It's always really exciting.


过去，我非常喜欢看克里斯蒂亚诺·罗纳尔多踢球。我看过他在皇家马德里、尤文图斯和葡萄牙队的比赛。我最喜欢的比赛是欧洲冠军联赛的比赛。欧洲冠军联赛是欧洲球队的最高比赛。每年的欧洲冠军联赛，世界上最好的球队都会相互对抗。这总是非常激动人心的。


Nowadays, I'm not really interested in sports anymore, but once in a while I like watching soccer.


如今，我对体育不再那么感兴趣了，但偶尔我还是喜欢观看足球比赛。
