Hey everybody, welcome to this A1 English listening practice video. You can use this video to practice your listening and comprehension as I speak.


_大家好，欢迎观看初级英语听力视频，你可以用这个视频练习英语听力和理解能力。_


Okay, today we're gonna talk about breakfast. This is my favorite meal of the day. So I'm happy to talk about it.


_好的，今天我想聊聊早餐，这是我一天中最喜欢的一餐。我很愿意聊这个话题。_


First, let's talk about breakfast in the US. Many people think that Americans eat a big breakfast every day. You've probably seen this in American movies and TV shows. You might see people eating eggs, bacon, sausage, pancakes and more.


_首先，让我们聊聊美国的早餐。很多人认为美国人每顿早餐都很丰盛。你大概是在美国电影和电视中看过。你可以看到人们在吃鸡蛋、培根、香肠和煎饼等。_


However, most Americans don't eat a really big breakfast on weekdays. Many people don't have time to cook a big breakfast before they go to work.


_然而，大多数美国人工作日的早餐不怎么丰盛。很多人工作日的早上没有那么多的时间做早饭。_


Actually, it's really common for people to just eat cereal. I did this a lot when I was a kid. But on weekends, people have more time to enjoy their breakfast in the morning. So people might eat the type of breakfast that you see in the movies.


_其实，早上只吃麦片是很常见的，我小时候就这样。但在周末，人们有更多的时候享用早餐。所以他们会吃得很好，就像电影里一样。_


I remember when I was a kid, my mom cooked more creative breakfasts on Saturdays and Sundays. My favorite breakfast that my mom cooked was crepes. I still remember how amazing they tasted.


_我记得我小时候我妈会在周末做很有新意的早餐。我最喜欢的早餐是我妈做的可丽饼，至今难忘。_


It's also common for Americans to go out for breakfast on weekends. Breakfast restaurants are really crowded on Saturday and Sunday mornings. And we also love enjoying a nice breakfast when we're on vacation. Basically, when we have the time, we love to eat a good breakfast.


_周末去外面吃早餐在美国也很常见。周末的早餐店人超多。我们也很享受假期的丰盛早餐。事实上，只要有时间，我们都愿意享受一顿美味的早餐。_


In many other countries, people don't eat a lot for breakfast. I remember when I was in Europe, I saw many people having only a little sweet bread and coffee for breakfast. This definitely isn't enough for me, but for other people, this is enough. I think that in many countries, breakfast isn't an important meal. Lunch and dinner are usually more important.


_在其他国家，人们吃的早餐也很简单。我记得在欧洲时，我看到人们就吃一些甜面包和咖啡当早餐。这对我来说肯定不够，但对有些人来说足够了。我觉得在有些国家，早餐不是很重要。午餐和晚餐才重要。_


In the US, some people say that breakfast is the most important meal of the day. What do you think? What's the most important meal of the day for you?


_在美国，很多人说早餐很重要，你觉得呢？你觉得哪顿饭比较重要？_


Now, let me describe my typical breakfast. Normally on weekdays, I eat eggs, bacon and fruit. I love the combination of bacon and eggs. They go together perfectly. I don't get tired of this food, even if I eat it every day. Of course, I always buy fresh and organic eggs, bacon and fruit. This is really important for me. And on weekends, I often go to restaurants to eat breakfast.


_现在，我来说说我的早餐。通常，工作日我会吃一些鸡蛋、培根和水果。我喜欢培根和鸡蛋的组合，这个组合很棒。即使我每天吃都不厌倦。当然，我总是买新鲜的有机鸡蛋、培根和水果。这对我很重要。周末我经常去早餐店吃饭。_


I love going out to eat breakfast. There are a lot of amazing breakfast restaurants where I live. So I have many options. I usually eat different breakfast foods at restaurants.


_我喜欢出去吃早饭。我住的地方有很多很棒的早餐店，所以我有很多选择。我经常在早餐店吃不同的食物。_


One of my favorite breakfasts is a Mexican dish called Chile kilis. I order this food all the time. And I also really like sweet breakfast foods like French toast, pancakes and sweet bread. As you can see, I love breakfast in general.


_我最喜欢吃的早餐之一是一种叫做“智利基利斯”的墨西哥菜。我经常点这个食物。我也很喜欢甜食早餐，比如法式吐司、煎饼和甜面包。正如你所见，我很喜欢早餐。_


One other thing that I sometimes have for breakfast is coffee. I don't drink coffee every day, and I don't really like caffeine, but I really like warm drinks. So I often order coffee or hot chocolate when I eat breakfast at restaurants.


_我早餐有时会喝咖啡。我并不是每天都喝咖啡，我也不太喜欢咖啡因，但我真的很喜欢热饮。所以我在餐馆吃早餐时，经常点咖啡或热巧克力。_


I know some people that need coffee in the morning. If they don't have coffee, then they can't start their day. I'm not like this. I sometimes have coffee with my breakfast, but it's not necessary.


_我知道有些人早上需要喝咖啡。如果他们不喝，他们就不能开始他们的一天。我不像这样。我有时早餐时喝咖啡，但这不是必须的。_
