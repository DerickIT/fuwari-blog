Hello Derick,


Certainly! Here's your study plan for the third day of the first week:


### Day 3: Numbers and Days of the Week


**Morning Session:**

- Begin with a quick review of the alphabet, sounds, and basic greetings from the previous days.
- Learn numbers 1-10 in English. Practice pronouncing each number several times.

**Afternoon Session:**

- Learn the days of the week: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. Write them down and practice their pronunciation.
- Try to use the numbers and days in simple sentences, such as "Today is Monday" or "I see three apples."

**Evening Session:**

- Review the numbers and days of the week by quizzing yourself or using flashcards.
- Write down the days of the week in order and associate each day with an activity you do (e.g., "On Monday, I study English").

### Verification of Learning Results:

- **Self-Recording**: Record yourself saying the numbers and days of the week to check your pronunciation.
- **Written Exercise**: Write down the numbers and days from memory.
- **Practical Application**: Tell me about your schedule using the days of the week and numbers, such as "I have English class on Tuesday and Thursday."

Keep practicing these new words throughout the day, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions. Good luck with your studies!


For the third day of the first week, we will focus on two main topics: Numbers and Days of the Week. Here are the specific materials and activities for each topic:

1. **Numbers 1-10**:
	- Materials: Flashcards with numbers 1-10 written on them, online videos or audio clips for pronunciation guidance.
	- Activities: Practice pronouncing each number, use the numbers in simple sentences, and quiz yourself or have someone quiz you on the numbers.
2. **Days of the Week**:
	- Materials: Flashcards with the days of the week written on them, songs or rhymes that help memorize the days of the week, online videos or audio clips for pronunciation guidance.
	- Activities: Practice pronouncing the days of the week, use the days in simple sentences (e.g., "Today is Monday"), and quiz yourself or have someone quiz you on the days of the week.

Remember, the goal is to familiarize yourself with these basic English words and be able to use them in simple sentences. Practice is key, so make sure to repeat the words and sentences several times throughout the day[1][2][3][4][5].
