On the first day of the fourth week, your learning tasks should include vocabulary building and an introduction to a new grammar concept. Here's a specific plan for the day:


### Vocabulary

- Learn 20 new words related to software technology and daily life. Here are some examples:
	- **Software Technology**: algorithm, application, code, database, encryption, hardware, interface, network, platform, software.
	- **Daily Life**: breakfast, supermarket, exercise, transportation, restaurant, appointment, weekend, family, weather, schedule.

### Grammar

- Introduction to the present simple tense for routines and habitual actions. Learn the structure of sentences in the present simple, focusing on the use of verbs in the third person singular (he, she, it) which often require an -s or -es ending.
	- Example sentences:
		- "He **writes** code every day."
		- "She **tests** the application before lunch."
		- "It **encrypts** the data automatically."

### Practice

- Create sentences using the new vocabulary in the present simple tense.
- Review the vocabulary and grammar rules at the end of the day to reinforce learning.

### Verification

- To verify your study results, you will be asked to use the new vocabulary in sentences and demonstrate your understanding of the present simple tense. We can have a brief conversation or written exchange where you apply what you've learned.

### Grammar


You should focus on the present simple tense. This tense is used to express habits, general truths, and sometimes future plans[5].


Here are some rules for forming the present simple tense[5]:

- In the third person singular (he, she, it), add -s, -es, or -ies to the base form of the verb. For example, "He writes code every day."
- Regular verbs just add an -s. For example, "She plays the guitar."
- Verbs that end in -s, -ss, -sh, -ch, -x, and -o, add an -es. For example, "He washes his car."
- Verbs that end in -y after a consonant, change the -y to -i and add -es. For example, "She studies English."

### Practice


You should practice using the new vocabulary in sentences in the present simple tense. For example, "He codes the application every day." or "I go to the supermarket every weekend."
