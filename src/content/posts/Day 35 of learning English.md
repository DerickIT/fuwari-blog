Dear Derick,


On the second day of Week 6, here are some effective ways to learn vocabulary and grammar:


**Vocabulary Learning**

1. **Non-Linguistic Representation**: Create a non-linguistic representation of the words you learned on the first day. This could be a drawing, a symbol, or a physical gesture that helps you remember the meaning of the word[2].
2. **Spaced Repetition**: Use spaced repetition to review the words. This method involves reviewing the words at increasing intervals over time. This is a proven method to help fix new words in your memory[5].
3. **Use in Context**: Try to use the new words in context. This could be in a sentence or a conversation. Using the words in context helps you understand how they are used and makes them easier to remember[1][5].

**Grammar Learning**

1. **Grammar Exercises**: Continue practicing the present perfect tense by doing more exercises. This could be filling in the blanks, rewriting sentences, or correcting mistakes in sentences[3].
2. **Use in Context**: Just like vocabulary, try to use the grammar point in context. This could be in a sentence or a conversation. Using the grammar point in context helps you understand how it is used and makes it easier to remember[3].
3. **Review**: Review the grammar point several times throughout the day. This can be done by writing sentences using the grammar point and saying them out loud[3].

Remember, the key to effective learning is consistency and practice. Review the vocabulary words and grammar points several times throughout the day to help you remember them[1][3].


On the second day of Week 6, here are the new words and grammar points you should focus on:


**Vocabulary Learning**


Based on the vocabulary list provided in the search results[5], here are 20 new words you should learn:

1. Ambiguous
2. Consensus
3. Discrepancy
4. Fluctuate
5. Inhibit
6. Predominant
7. Subsequent
8. Accumulate
9. Constrain
10. Diminish
11. Emerge
12. Inevitable
13. Preliminary
14. Summarize
15. Adjacent
16. Commodity
17. Discrete
18. Exclude
19. Inherent
20. Prospect

For each word, understand its meaning, pronunciation, and usage in a sentence. You can use the context clues provided in the sentences from the vocabulary list[5] to understand how each word is used.


**Grammar Learning**


On the second day, continue with the present perfect tense, but also introduce the past perfect tense. The past perfect tense is used to describe an action that occurred and was completed in the past before another past action[2][3]. Practice constructing sentences using this tense, such as "I had studied English before I met Judy."


Remember to review these words and the grammar point several times throughout the day to help you remember them.
