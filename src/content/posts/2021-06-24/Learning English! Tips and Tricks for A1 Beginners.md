Hey everybody, welcome to this A1 English listening practice video. You can use this video to train your listening and comprehension as I speak.


_大家好，欢迎观看这个 A1 级别的英语练习视频。你可以用这个视频练习你的听力和英语理解能力。_


You ready? So today I'm going to talk about language learning. If you're watching this video, you're probably learning English. So I hope this is an interesting topic for you.


_准备好了吗？今天我想聊聊关于如何学习第二语言。如果你正在看这个视频，你大概是在学习英语。那么，我希望这是一个你感兴趣的话题。_


Language learning is hard, and if you learn a language, you need to spend a lot of time studying. This is the most important part of learning a language: time. If you don't spend a lot of time studying, you won't learn English. Language learning takes time.


_学习第二语言很难，如果你想学一门语言，你得付出很多时间。这是学习语言最重要的部分：时间。如果你不花大量时间学习，你肯定学不会。学习语言需要时间。（这段有凑字数的嫌疑）_


I am a language teacher, but I'm also a language learner. I learn languages because it's fun for me, and I love talking to people from other countries. This is the best part about learning another language: You can talk to many people and make new friends. I talk to people from many different countries. This is the fun part of learning languages. But language learning is not easy.


_我是一个教语言的老师，也是一个语言学习者。学习语言是因为我觉得很有趣，我很喜欢和不同国家的人聊天。学习语言最重要的是可以和很不同国家的人聊天，认识很多新朋友。我会和不同国家的人聊天，这是学习语言最有趣的部分。但学语言并不容易。_


Sometimes I get sad or frustrated when I can't understand somebody. I also get nervous when I talk to people in other languages. but that's okay, it's normal to get sad or frustrated or nervous when you learn another language.


_有时，当我不理解某人说什么时我会感到很沮丧。当我用其他语言跟人交流时也会感到紧张。但没关系；当你学习另一门语言时，感到悲伤、沮丧或紧张是正常的。_


This is normal. Sometimes I make big mistakes when I'm speaking other languages. I make mistakes with grammar, with vocabulary, and with pronunciation. But this is normal. Everybody makes mistakes when they speak other languages. If you don't make mistakes, you won't improve. To improve, To get better, you need to make mistakes. You need to talk, you need to practice, you need to have fun. So don't worry about your mistakes. Have fun with English.


_这很正常，有时，当我说其他语言时会犯很大的错。我会犯语法、词汇和发音的错。但这很正常，每个人在说其他语言时都会犯错。如果你不犯错，就不会进步。为了进步，为了变得更牛逼，你得犯错。你得去说，去练，你得找到乐趣。所以不要担心犯错，去享受学英语的乐趣。_


If you don't have fun, it is harder to learn English. So here are some tips to have fun with English.


_如果你感受不到学英语的乐趣，那学起来就很困难。这里有几个小技巧可以帮助你找到学英语的乐趣。_


No. 1, read books in English that are interesting for you. Don't read boring books. Find books that you like. For example, if you like sports, read books in English about sports. If you like animals, read books in English about animals. And if you like technology, read books in English about technology. I love fiction, so I read fiction books in other languages. This helps me have fun and learn.


_第一，阅读你感兴趣的英语书，不要看无聊的书，去找你喜欢的内容。比如，如果你对运动感兴趣，就读运动相关的英语书。如果你对动物感兴趣，就读动物相关的英语书。如果你对科技感兴趣，就读科技相关的英语书。我喜欢小说，所以我会看其他语言的小说。这有助于我享受并学习语言。_


Tip No. 2, watch videos in English that are interesting for you. If you like fashion and clothes, watch YouTube videos about fashion in English. If you like cars, watch YouTube videos about cars in English. It's important to read and watch things that are interesting for you.


_第二，看你感兴趣的英文视频 ，如果你喜欢时尚和服装，就看时尚相关的英语视频。如果你喜欢汽车，就看汽车相关的英语视频。阅读和观看感兴趣的英语内容很重要。_


Okay, tip No. 3, make friends who speak English and make friends who are learning English. I know it's not easy to make friends, but it will help you learn and practice your English. Find an English practice group in your city. You can look for an English practice group on meetup.com. If you can practice your English with friends, it will help you a lot.


_第三，去跟说英语和学英语的人交朋友。我知道这很难，但这对你学英语很有帮助。在你所有城市中找到学英语的组织，你也可以在meetup.com上找到。如果你能和朋友一起练习英语，那会对你有很大的帮助。（这里推荐 Toastmasters 俱乐部，国内大多数城市都有，如果你找不到，给我发私信或评论告诉我你所在城市。）_
