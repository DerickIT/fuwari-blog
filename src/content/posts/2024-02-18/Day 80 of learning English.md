### Week 12, Day 7: Comprehensive Review and Relaxation


**Learning Content:**

- **Comprehensive Review:** Spend the morning reviewing challenging areas from the past weeks. This could include complex grammar structures, vocabulary, idioms, or pronunciation issues.
- **Relaxed Conversations:** In the afternoon, engage in relaxed English conversations with friends or a language exchange partner. The focus should be on enjoying the process of using the language rather than on accuracy.

**Testing Standards:**

- **Self-Assessment:** Reflect on your progress over the past 12 weeks. Identify areas where you feel confident and areas that still require improvement.
- **Peer Feedback:** During your relaxed conversations, ask for informal feedback from your conversation partners on your fluency and comprehension.

**Verification:**

- **Progress Journal:** Keep a journal entry summarizing your reflections on your learning journey, noting improvements and future goals.
- **Informal Conversation Recording:** Record a conversation and listen to it to self-assess your speaking and listening skills. Look for natural use of language and ease of communication.

By the end of the seventh day of week 12, you should have a clear understanding of your overall progress and be able to use English more confidently in a variety of settings.
