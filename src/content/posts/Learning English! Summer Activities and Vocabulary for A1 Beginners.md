So today, I'm gonna talk about summer for some of you, it's summer now, and for others, it's winter. Here where I live, it's the summer season now.


_今天，我要聊的是夏天，对你们中的一些人来说，现在是夏天，而对其他人来说，现在是冬天。在我住的地方，现在是夏季。_


So first, let's talk about summer weather. In most countries, this is the hottest time of year. In cold countries, summer is the only time of year when it's hot. In tropical countries, there isn't much difference between the seasons, but summer is definitely hot.


_首先，让我们来聊聊夏天的天气。在大多数国家，这是一年中最热的时候。在寒冷的国家，夏季是一年中唯一热的时候。在热带国家，季节之间没有太大差异，但夏季绝对很热。_


I really like hot, sunny weather. Some people don't like this weather, so they prefer other seasons. How about you? Do you prefer hot or cold weather? Also, in some places, summer is the rainy season. Where I live now, it rains a lot in the summer. I don't like this. I grew up in Southern California where it doesn't rain a lot. So I'm used to blue skies and sunny weather. For me, rainy weather isn't fun. I like to go outside and do activities, but it's hard to do this when it's raining.


_我非常喜欢热天、晴朗的天气。有些人不喜欢这种天气，所以他们更喜欢其他季节。你呢？你喜欢炎热还是寒冷的天气？此外，在一些地方，夏天是雨季。我现在住的地方，夏天雨水很多。我不喜欢这样。我在南加州长大，那里雨水不多。所以我习惯了蓝天和晴朗的天气。对我来说，雨天很没意思。我喜欢外出进行活动，但在下雨的时候很难做到这一点。_


Let's talk about some summer activities that people like to do. During the hot summer days. Many people like going to the beach. The water is usually warmer during this season, so it's a good time to swim. Some people like to lie on the sand and enjoy the hot sun, but I don't do this. I sometimes like swimming at the beach, but I definitely don't sunbathe. I get sunburned very easily.


_让我们来聊聊人们喜欢在夏天做的一些活动。在炎热的夏日里，许多人喜欢去海滩。这个季节的水通常比较温暖，所以是游泳的好时机。有些人喜欢躺在沙滩上享受炎热的阳光，但我不这么做。我有时会喜欢在海滩上游泳，但我绝对不会晒太阳。我很容易晒伤。_


Another thing that many Americans do in the summer is have barbecues. This season is perfect for barbecues, because you can spend the afternoon outside with your family and friends. The kids can run around and play while the adults relax and talk. And of course, everyone enjoys eating good food at barbecues. I love eating hamburgers and hot dogs outside on warm from summer days.


_许多美国人在夏天做的另一件事是举办烧烤。这个季节非常适合烧烤，因为你可以在户外与家人和朋友一起度过下午。孩子们可以跑来跑去玩耍，而成年人则可以放松和交谈。当然，每个人都喜欢在烧烤时享用美食。我喜欢在温暖的夏日户外吃汉堡和热狗。_


Also, many Americans have swimming pools, so the summer months are a great time to use them. When I was a kid, my family always went in the pool during this time of year. I have great memories of playing with my sister and my friends in our pool. It's always fun to go in the pool during the summer. People who don't have swimming pools can go to public pools. In big cities, there are usually public swimming pools where you can go during the summer or during other months.


_此外，许多美国人拥有游泳池，因此夏季是使用它们的绝佳时机。我小时候，我的家人总是在这个时间里去游泳池。我对我们在游泳池里和我的妹妹还有朋友们玩耍的美好回忆。在夏天去游泳池总是很有趣的。没有游泳池的人可以去公共游泳池。在大城市里，通常有公共游泳池，你可以在夏天或其他月份去那里。_


One other popular summer activity in the US is camping. Summer is the perfect time to go camping, because you don't get too cold at night. Usually people sleep outside in tents when they camp. So it's better to do this activity when it's warm. I've camped in the summer and in the winter, but it's definitely better in the summer. A lot of people go hiking when they camp, which is also better in the summer, in my opinion.


_另一种在美国流行的夏季活动是露营。夏天是去露营的完美时机，因为晚上你不会太冷。通常人们露营时会睡在帐篷里。所以最好在温暖的时候进行这项活动。我夏天和冬天都露营过，但绝对是夏天更好。很多人露营时会去远足，在我看来，夏天更合适。_


All right, now let's talk about summer vacation in the US, children usually have a long break from school during the summer. When I was in elementary school and middle school, I had two and a half months of summer vacation. The school year ended in the middle of June, and the next school year began in September. This is a long break. I had time to do many things during these months. Many American children go to summer camp during this break. There are many types of summer camps where kids do fun activities, learn new things and spend time outdoors. I went to a few sports summer camps when I was a kid. Also, many people travel during this season, because children don't have to go to school.


_好的，现在让我们来谈谈美国的暑假，孩子们在夏天通常有一段长时间的学校假期。当我在小学和中学的时候，我有两个月半的暑假。学期在六月中旬结束，下个学期在九月份开始。这是一个很长的假期。在这几个月份里，我有时间做很多事情。许多美国孩子在这段时间里去夏令营。有很多类型的夏令营，孩子们在那里进行有趣的活动，学习新东西，并且花时间在户外。当我还是个孩子的时候，我去过几个体育夏令营。此外，很多人在这个季节旅行，因为孩子们不用上学。_


Summer is also a good time to travel because of the good weather. But the bad thing about traveling in the summer is that many touristic places are crowded at this time. This means that there are many people there, so I prefer to travel during other seasons.


_夏天也是旅行的好时机，因为天气好。但是夏天旅行的缺点是许多旅游景点在这个时候都很拥挤。这意味着那里有很多人，所以我更喜欢在其他季节旅行。_
