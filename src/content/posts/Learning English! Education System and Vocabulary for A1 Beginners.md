So today I'm gonna talk about education. This is an essential topic because education is an important part of our lives. Most people get some kind of education. Education is different in different countries. But today we'll talk about education in the US.


_今天我要谈论教育。这是一个重要的主题，因为教育是我们生活中重要的一部分。大多数人会接受某种形式的教育。不同国家的教育各不相同。但今天我们要谈论美国的教育。_


So first, let's talk about the different levels of education in the US.


_那么首先，让我们来谈谈美国不同的教育水平。_


The first level of education is preschool. In the US, kids go to preschool when they're 4 years old. But not everyone goes to preschool. Some people don't go. I went to preschool when I was 4. I didn't like it because I was very shy. I didn't like playing with other kids when I was young. In preschool, children play a lot, but they also learn. After preschool, children go to kindergarten. Usually kids start kindergarten when they're 5 years old. In kindergarten, children start learning more things. For example, they learn to read, write and make art. They also learn how to be good students. I remember that when I was in kindergarten, we had discipline. If we did something bad, we got in trouble. I never got in trouble because I was a good student.


_教育的第一级是学前教育。在美国，孩子们四岁时去上幼儿园。但不是每个人都上幼儿园。有些人不去。我四岁的时候去了幼儿园。我不喜欢它，因为我当时非常害羞。我小时候不喜欢和其他孩子玩。在幼儿园，孩子们玩很多，但他们也学习。幼儿园之后，孩子们去上小学。通常孩子们五岁时开始上小学。在小学，孩子们开始学习更多的东西。例如，他们学习阅读、写作和制作艺术。他们还学习如何成为好学生。我记得当我在小学时，我们有纪律。如果我们做了坏事，我们就会陷入麻烦。我从未陷入麻烦，因为我是一个好学生。_


So after kindergarten, you go to elementary school. In the US, most elementary schools include 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th grade. But some elementary schools don't include 6th grade. In each year of elementary school, you only have one teacher. You have the same teacher all year. In my opinion, elementary school isn't that difficult in the US. Of course, you get homework, but it's not too much. In elementary school, you learn many things like math, science, history, and English. At this level, you spend about six hours at school.


_所以上完幼儿园后，你就去上小学。在美国，大多数小学包括一到六年级。但有些小学不包括六年级。在小学的每个学年，你只有一个老师。你全年都有同一个老师。在我看来，美国的小学并不太困难。当然，你会有家庭作业，但并不是太多。在小学，你会学到很多知识，比如数学、科学、历史和英语。在这个学习阶段，你每天在学校大约待六个小时。_


Then after elementary school, you go to middle school or junior high. I say middle school, but both of these names are correct. Middle school usually includes 7th and 8th grade. At this level, students have many teachers, like 6 or 7. I had six different classes each year in middle school. Each class was one hour long. I didn't like middle school. It's much harder than elementary school. You get more homework and you have more tests. Then after middle school, you go to high school.


_然后小学毕业后，你会去上中学或者初中。我说中学，但这两个名称都是正确的。中学通常包括七年级和八年级。在这个学习阶段，学生有很多老师，比如6个或7个。我在中学每年有六门不同的课。每节课都是一小时长。我不喜欢中学。它比小学难多了。你会有更多的作业，还有更多的考试。然后中学毕业后，你会去上高中。_


In the US, high school includes 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th grade. This is the most important time for students in the US. If you wanna go to college, then it's important to do well in high school. High school can be difficult, but it depends on your teachers. Some teachers give a lot of homework and some teachers don't. And some teachers are good at teaching and some teachers aren't. I had some good teachers in high school, but I also had some bad teachers. So after high school, some people go to college and some people don't. Of course, there are different levels of university and you can earn different degrees there.


_在美国，高中包括9年级、10年级、11年级和12年级。这是美国学生最重要的时期。如果你想上大学，那么在高中表现好就很重要。高中可能会很困难，但这取决于你的老师。有些老师布置很多作业，有些老师则不然。有些老师擅长教学，有些则不擅长。我在高中时遇到了一些好老师，但也遇到了一些不好的老师。所以高中毕业后，有些人会去上大学，有些人则不会。当然，大学有不同的层次，你可以在那里获得不同的学位。_


Okay, so lastly, let's look at a few important vocabulary words related to education. First, let's talk about the word grades. We use the word grades to talk about how well you did in a class or on a test. In the US, these grades are A, B, C, D, and F. And an A grade is the best and an F grade is the worst.


_好的，最后，让我们来看一些与教育相关的重要的词汇。首先，让我们谈谈“成绩”这个词。我们用“成绩”这个词来谈论你在一门课程或一次考试中的表现如何。在美国，这些成绩是A、B、C、D和F。A等级是最好的，F等级是最差的。_


Okay, the next word is recess. In the US, recess is the short break that elementary school students have during their school day. During recess, students play, talk, or eat a snack. This break is usually 20 or 30 minutes.


_好的，下一个词是“课间休息”。在美国，课间休息是小学生在一天的学校生活中所享有的短暂休息时间。在课间休息时，学生们玩耍、交谈或吃点心。这个休息时间通常是20或30分钟。_


Okay, the last phrase you should learn is bachelor's degree. A bachelor's degree is the degree you get after 4 years of university. It's lower than a master's degree.


_好的，你最后应该学习的一个短语是“学士学位”。学士学位是你在大学学习四年后获得的学位。它低于硕士学位。_
