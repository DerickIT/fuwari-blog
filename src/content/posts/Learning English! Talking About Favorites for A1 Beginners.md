Okay, today we're gonna talk about some of my favorite things. We all like talking about things we like and I wanted to make a video about some things that I like.


_今天我想聊一些我喜欢的事情。我们都喜欢聊自己喜欢的事情。我想做一个这样的视频。_


So first I want to talk about my favorite dessert. This is a really hard one for me to choose. I love a lot of desserts, and so it's hard for me to decide which one is my favorite. But I think that right now my favorite dessert is homemade chocolate chip cookies. Notice that I said homemade. There's a big difference between homemade cookies and cookies you buy from the store. In my opinion, homemade cookies are much better than other cookies. And the perfect homemade cookie is the chocolate chip cookie.


_首先，我想聊聊我最喜欢的甜点。对我来说，选择这个真的很难。我喜欢很多甜点，所以很难决定哪一个是我的最爱。但我认为现在，我最喜欢的甜点是自制巧克力豆饼干。注意我说了“自制”。自制饼干和从商店里买的饼干有很大的区别。在我看来，自制饼干比其他饼干要好得多。而完美的自制饼干就是巧克力豆饼干。_


In the US, it's really common for families to make the this dessert together. Usually children help their parents prepare and bake these cookies. It's a fun activity for the family, and the result is delicious.


_在美国，家人们一起制作这种甜点真的很普遍。通常孩子们会帮助他们的父母准备和烘焙这些饼干。这是一项有趣的家庭活动，而且做出来的甜点非常美味。_


Okay, next, let me tell you about my favorite month of the year. This is another hard one, but I think that my favorite month is April. The reason is because I really like sunshine and long days in April. Winter is finally over. The days get longer and the weather gets warmer. I don't have to worry about cold weather or rain. This is perfect for me.


_接下来，让我告诉你我一年中最喜欢的月份。这也是个难题，但我认为我最喜欢四月。因为我真的很喜欢四月的阳光和长日。冬天终于结束了。白天变长了，天气变暖了。我不用担心寒冷的天气或下雨。这对我来说很完美。_


Okay, how about my favorite sport? My answer to this question has changed many times in my life. When I was a young kid, my favorite sport was basketball. I was a big fan of the Los Angeles Lakers, and I played basketball on many teams.


_来说说我最喜欢的运动怎么样？我在不同的年龄阶段喜欢不同的运动。我小时候，最喜欢的运动是篮球。我是洛杉矶湖人队的超级粉丝，我也在很多球队打过篮球。_


After that, my favorite sport was football. And I really liked this Seattle Seahawks for many years. Then my favorite sport became soccer, and I started watching it a lot. But now I don't know if I have a favorite sport. I don't really watch sports anymore. So it's hard to say. But I wanna mention my favorite sport to play. I've played many sports in my life, but the funniest one for me is golf. In my opinion, it's the most challenging sport. It's really hard. But once you start to get better, it's really fun.


_在那之后，我最喜欢的运动是足球。我喜欢西雅图海鹰队很多年了。然后我最喜欢的运动变成了足球，我开始经常看。但现在我不知道我是否有最喜欢的运动。我不再真的看体育比赛了。所以很难说。但我想提一下我最喜欢的运动。我一生中玩过很多运动，但对我来说最有趣的是高尔夫。在我看来，这是最具挑战性的运动。它真的很难。但一旦你开始变得更好，它真的很有趣。_


All right. Lastly, let me talk about my favorite language that I've studied. I like all the languages that I've Learned, but the funniest one for me to study is Greek. The main reason why is because Greek has a different alphabet.


_最后，聊聊我学过的最喜欢的语言。我喜欢我学过的所有语言，但对我来说最有趣的是希腊语。主要原因是希腊语有一个不同的字母表。_


I love the challenge of learning a completely new system. It's really cool to see Greek writing and be able to read it and understand it. I also really like the sound of the language. It's a beautiful language and it feels good to speak it.


_我喜欢学习一个全新的系统所带来的挑战。能够阅读并理解希腊文书写真的很酷。我也非常喜欢这门语言的声音。它是一门美丽的语言，说起来感觉很好。_


Currently, I don't study this language, so I've forgotten almost everything, but I'll definitely start learning it again in the future.


_目前，我不在学习这门语言，所以我几乎忘记了所有的东西，但我将来一定会重新开始学习它。_
