On the fourth day of Week 10 in the study plan, you should complete the following specific tasks:

1. **Prepare Chunk D**: Dedicate 1 hour to preparing new study material. This could involve learning new vocabulary, grammar points, or language skills[5].
2. **Review Chunk C**: Spend 30 minutes reviewing the material you prepared on the third day. This review should be active, involving self-testing and evaluating your learning to ensure you understand the material well[5].
3. **Review Chunk B**: Dedicate 15 minutes to review the material you prepared on the second day to reinforce your learning[5].
4. **Review Chunk A**: Spend another 15 minutes reviewing the material from the first day to aid in long-term retention[5].

These tasks are designed to follow a structured approach to learning, breaking down the material into manageable chunks and reviewing them progressively to enhance understanding and retention.
