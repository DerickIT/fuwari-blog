On the second day of the fourth week, your learning tasks should continue with vocabulary building and further practice of the present simple tense. Here's a specific plan for the day:


### Vocabulary

- Learn another set of 20 new words related to software technology and daily life. Here are some examples:
	- **Software Technology**: bug, compiler, debug, firewall, framework, frontend, backend, server, query, variable.
	- **Daily Life**: grocery, laundry, commute, hobby, vacation, meeting, deadline, traffic, recipe, chores.

### Grammar

- Continue practicing the present simple tense. Focus on forming negative sentences and asking questions in the present simple.
	- Negative sentences: "He does not (doesn't) write code on weekends."
	- Questions: "Does she test the application every day?"

### Practice

- Create sentences using the new vocabulary in the present simple tense, both in affirmative and negative forms, and also form questions.
- Review the vocabulary and grammar rules at the end of the day to reinforce learning.

### Verification

- To verify your study results, you will be asked to use the new vocabulary in sentences and demonstrate your understanding of the present simple tense in its different forms. We can have a brief conversation or written exchange where you apply what you've learned.
