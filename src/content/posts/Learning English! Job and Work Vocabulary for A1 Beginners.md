You ready? So today I'm gonna talk about jobs. This is a really common topic because most adults have a job or some type of work. Let's talk about the different types of jobs that people have.


_准备好了吗，今天我想聊聊工作。这是一个很普遍的话题，因为每个成年人都有某种类型的工作。让我们聊聊人们不同类型的工作。_


One common type of job is a part-time job. A part-time job is a job where you work fewer hours. I had part-time jobs when I was younger. I worked part-time at a clothing store, at a restaurant, and at my university. Many students have part-time jobs. They study in the morning and work in the evening. I did this when I was a student.


_有一种普遍的工作叫兼职，工作时间比较少。我年轻的时候在服装店、餐厅和大学做过兼职。很多学生都做过兼职，他们白天学习，晚上工作。我学生时期没有做过。_


In the US. Many teenagers get a job when they're in high school. I got my first job when I was 17. I was in my last year of high school. I worked at a clothing store called Hollister. I didn't like that job, but I liked earning money.


_在美国，很多青少年高中时就找到了工作。我17岁时有了第一份工作。我高中最后一年在一家叫 Hollister 的服装店工作。我不是很喜欢那份工作，但我喜欢赚钱。_


Some of my classmates worked at fast-food restaurants like McDonald's. I also had a part-time job when I was in college. I worked at the university's dining hall. A dining hall is the place on a university campus where students eat. I worked as a cook and a dishwasher at my dining hall. I didn't like washing dishes. I liked cooking more than dishwashing. How about you? Have you ever had a part-time job?


_我有一些同学在类似麦当劳的快餐店工作，我大学时期也做过。我在大学食堂工作过，就是学生吃饭的地方。我负责做饭和洗碗。我不喜欢洗碗，我比较喜欢做饭。你呢？你做过兼职吗？_


Okay, now let's talk about full-time jobs. In the US, people who have full-time jobs usually work 40 hours a week or more. Some people work a lot more, like 50 or 60 hours a week. For some full-time jobs, you need a college degree. For other full-time jobs, you don't need a degree.


_现在，我们聊聊全职工作。在美国，人们每周全职工作40多个小时，有些人还要多一点，50或60个小时每周。有些工作需要大学文凭，有些不需要。_


In the US, there are many different jobs available in different industries. Some examples of industries are finance, marketing, medicine, IT, and education. I work in the education industry because I'm a teacher.


_在美国，不同行业有不同的工作机会。比如：金融、营销、医药、IT 和教育。我在教育行业工作，因为我是老师。_


There are many good jobs in the US for people who don't have degrees. For example, you can be an electrician, a plumber, a truck driver, or many other things. People who have these jobs make good money in the US. Most salaries in America are high compared to other countries. Americans make a lot of money, but they have to spend a lot of money. Life is very expensive in the US.


_在美国还有很多不需要文凭的工作。例如，您可以是电工、水管工、卡车司机或许多其工作。拥有这些工作的人在美国赚了很多钱。与其他国家相比，美国的大多数薪水都很高。美国人赚了很多钱，但他们必须花很多钱。在美国，生活非常昂贵。_


The normal schedule for full-time jobs is from 9 am to 5 pm in the US. However, some people start work earlier, like at 8 am, and other people end later, like at 6 pm. I start work pretty early at 7:00 am, but I also finish early at 4:30 pm. I prefer starting work early and finishing work early. Most people work Monday to Friday, and they have weekends off. Most people don't like working on the weekends. I work in the morning on Saturdays, but I have Sundays off. I never work on Sundays. How about you? What's your work schedule?


_在美国，全职工作的正常时间表是从上午 9 点到下午 5 点。但是，有些人开始工作得更早，比如早上 8 点，而另一些人下班时间晚，比如下午 6 点。我早上 7：00 就开始工作，但我也会在下午 4：30 早早下班。我更喜欢早点开始工作，早点结束工作。大多数人周一至周五工作，周末休息。大多数人不喜欢在周末工作。我周六早上工作，但周日休息。我星期天从不工作。你怎幺样？你的工作日程是怎样的？_
