Hey everybody, welcome to this A1 English listening practice video. You can use this video to practice your listening and comprehension as I speak. You ready?


_大家好，欢迎观看初练英语听力练习视频。你可以用这个视频练习英语听力和理解能力。准备好了吗？_


So today I'm going to talk about my daily routine. My routine is different on weekdays and weekends. I'll tell you about my routine on weekdays.


_今天，我想聊聊我的日常生活。工作日和休息日有所不同。我会告诉你我在工作日的日常。_


So I normally wake up at about 6 or 6:00 am. I like waking up early. I don't like getting up late. When I wake up, the first thing I do is read my Bible. Then I study languages for a little while. Currently, I'm studying Indonesian. I like to study in the morning because I feel motivated. Other people prefer studying in the evening. Do you like studying in the morning, afternoon, or evening?


_我通常6点或6点半起床。我喜欢早起，不喜欢睡懒觉。醒来第一件事先读圣经，然后学一会语言。目前，我正在学习印度尼西亚语。我喜欢早上学习，因为我感觉早上更有动力，有些人喜欢晚上学习。你呢？_


So after I study, I usually eat some fruit. This is my first food of the day. Then I start my work. I usually start working at 7:30 am. Most other people start at 8 am or 9 am. I like starting early though.


_在我学习之前，我通常会吃一些水果。这是我每天吃的第一种食物。然后就开始工作。我通常早上7点半开始工作。大多数人8点或9点开始工作。不过，我喜欢早一点。_


I'm an English teacher and I teach many students. I have different students every day. Some days I have many classes and other days I have fewer classes. Most of my students are from Brazil and Russia, but I have students from many other countries too. Every day I talk to people from all over the world. This is really fun. I love my job.


_我是一个英语，老师，有很多学生。每天都有不同的学生。有些时候课很多，有时少一点，大多数学生来自巴西和俄罗斯，但也有来自其他国家的。我每天和来自不同国家的人聊天。这很有意思。我热爱我的工作。_


So during my workday, I have some breaks. Sometimes I have a 30-minute break between classes. During my breaks, I eat, study, and hang out with my wife. My last class usually ends at 4:30 or 5:00 pm. Many Americans get off work at 5:00 pm.


_在工作期间我有一些休息时间。有时候在课间有半个小时的休息。在休息时间，我会吃点东西，学习或和老婆出去溜达溜达。我最后一节课在4点半或5点结束。大多数美国人5点下班。_


After I get off work, I eat dinner. My wife cooks dinner every weekday, so we eat at home. I'm always hungry when I finish work. In the US, people eat dinner early, like at 6:00 pm. This is very common. In other countries, people eat dinner late, like at 9:00 pm. I don't like this. For us, dinner is the biggest meal of the day. We eat a lot for dinner. My wife and I eat meat, vegetables, and other food.


_我下班后就吃晚饭。我老婆每个工作日都会做饭，所以我们在家吃。每次结束工作我都饿得要死。在美国，人们差不多6点吃晚饭。这很普遍。在其他国家，人们晚饭吃得晚，差不多9点。我不喜欢这么晚吃饭。对我们来说，晚餐是一天中最重要的一顿饭。我和我老婆吃了肉，蔬菜和一些其他食物。_


Some days I exercise in the evening, too. I don't exercise every day, only some days. I should exercise more, though. After I exercise and eat dinner, I eat dessert. I normally have milk and cookies. I love milk and cookies. After dessert, I study my languages more. Then I spend time with my wife. Lastly, I take a shower, brush my teeth, and get ready for bed. I usually go to bed at 10:00 pm. So that's my normal routine on weekdays.


_有些日子我也会在晚上锻炼。我不是每天都锻炼，只有几天。不过，我应该多运动。运动和吃晚饭后，我吃甜点。我通常吃牛奶和饼干。我喜欢牛奶和饼干。吃完甜点后，我更多地学习我的语言。然后我花时间和我的妻子在一起。最后，我洗个澡，刷牙，准备睡觉。我通常在晚上 10：00 上床睡觉。这就是我平日的例行公事。_


I like to have a consistent routine. I plan my days, and I try to follow my plan. Some people don't like planning their days. They prefer to do different things every day. I like doing different things too, but I like having a general plan to follow. If I don't have a general plan, I feel lost.


_我喜欢日常生活保持一致。我计划我的日常并尝试按计划执行。人们不怎么喜欢计划自己的日常生活，他们喜欢体验每天不同的生活，我也喜欢体验不同的生活，但喜欢有一个大致的计划去执行。如果我没有做计划，我会感觉不自在。_


I like having a daily routine. However, on the weekends, I do many different activities. My weekends are very different from my weekdays, but I always wake up and go to bed at the same time every day. That doesn't change. I like to start and end every day at the same time.


_工作日我喜欢按计划工作，但周末我喜欢体验不同的事件。我周末的生活和工作日很不同。但我总是按时起床和睡觉，这不会改变。我喜欢有规律的生活。_
