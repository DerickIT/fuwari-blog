On the fourth day of the fourth week, your learning tasks should focus on enhancing your listening skills and practicing the present simple tense with adverbs of frequency. Here's a specific plan for the day:


### Listening Comprehension

- Continue listening to English podcasts or watching videos related to software technology. Try to understand the main ideas and details of what you listen to. Write down new words and phrases, and look up their meanings.

### Vocabulary

- Review the 40 words you've learned in the past three days. Practice their pronunciation and usage in sentences.

### Grammar

- Continue practicing the present simple tense, focusing on forming negative sentences and questions. Also, practice using adverbs of frequency (always, usually, often, sometimes, rarely, never) in sentences.
	- Example: "She rarely encounters a bug in the code." "Do they always meet the deadline?"

### Practice

- Create sentences using the vocabulary you've learned, incorporating adverbs of frequency and the present simple tense.
- Try to listen to and repeat sentences from the podcasts or videos you've listened to. This will help improve your pronunciation and intonation.

### Verification

- To verify your study results, you will be asked to use the vocabulary and grammar you've learned in conversation or written exchange. You should also be able to summarize the main ideas of the podcasts or videos you've listened to.
1. **Grammar Exercises**: Complete grammar exercises that focus on the present simple tense and the use of adverbs of frequency. This will help reinforce your understanding of these grammar points[1].
2. **Writing Practice**: Write short paragraphs or sentences using the present simple tense and adverbs of frequency. Try to incorporate the vocabulary you've learned so far[2].
3. **Listening and Repeating**: Listen to English podcasts or watch videos, and try to repeat the sentences you hear, especially those that use the present simple tense and adverbs of frequency. This will help you get used to the natural rhythm and intonation of English sentences[3].
4. **Conversation Practice**: Have conversations in English, either with a language exchange partner or a tutor. Try to use the present simple tense and adverbs of frequency in your conversations[3].
5. **Daily Grammar Lessons**: Follow a blog or website that posts daily grammar lessons. This can provide you with a consistent source of new grammar points to learn and practice[3].
