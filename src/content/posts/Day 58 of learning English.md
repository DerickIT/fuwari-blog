Dear Derick,


On the sixth day of the ninth week, we will focus on understanding the differences between formal and informal language in English, particularly in the context of technology and software. Here's your plan for the day:


**Morning Session (1 hour):**

- Learn the differences between formal and informal language. Formal language is typically used in professional, academic, or official contexts, while informal language is used in everyday conversation and casual contexts.
- Practice writing an email to a colleague about a software issue using formal language. This should include appropriate greetings, clear and concise language, and a professional tone.

**Evening Session (30 minutes):**

- Write a message to a friend about the same software issue using informal language. This can be more casual and conversational, and it's okay to use slang or abbreviations that you would normally use in a casual conversation.

**Verification of Study Results:**

- Send me the email and message you've written. I will review them to ensure you're using formal and informal language appropriately and provide feedback or corrections if necessary.

Understanding the differences between formal and informal language will help you communicate effectively in different contexts. Remember, practice is key, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions.
