Hello Derick,


Absolutely! Here's your study plan for the fourth day of the first week:


### Day 4: Common Verbs and Subjects


**Morning Session:**

- Start with a quick review of the alphabet, sounds, basic greetings, numbers, and days of the week from the previous days.
- Learn common verbs such as "be", "have", "do", and "go". Practice pronouncing each verb and writing it down.

**Afternoon Session:**

- Learn the concept of subjects in English: "I", "you", "he", "she", "it", "we", "they". Write them down and practice pronouncing them.
- Try to use the verbs and subjects in simple sentences, such as "I am Derick" or "You are Judy".

**Evening Session:**

- Review the verbs and subjects by quizzing yourself or using flashcards.
- Write down the verbs and subjects in order and try to use them in sentences.

### Verification of Learning Results:

- **Self-Recording**: Record yourself saying the verbs and subjects to check your pronunciation.
- **Written Exercise**: Write down the verbs and subjects from memory and use them in sentences.
- **Practical Application**: Tell me about yourself using the verbs and subjects you've learned, such as "I am Derick. I have a goal to learn English."
