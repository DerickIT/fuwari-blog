Dear Derick,


On the second day of your eleventh week, you should focus on expanding your vocabulary related to technology, particularly software and hardware terms, and engage in a conversation with me about recent developments in software technology. Here's your plan for the day:


### Tuesday:


### Morning:

- **Study Vocabulary:** Learn specific terms related to software technology, such as "programming," "application," "operating system," "user interface," and "database."
- **Practice Usage:** Use these terms in sentences to understand their context and meaning.

### Afternoon:

- **Engage in Conversation:** Have a discussion with me about recent developments in software technology. This could include topics like new software releases, updates to existing platforms, or trends in the tech industry.
- **Apply Vocabulary:** Make sure to incorporate the vocabulary you learned in the morning into our conversation.

### Verification of Study Results:

- **Conversation Review:** After our discussion, we will review the conversation to assess your use of the new vocabulary and to provide feedback on areas for improvement.
- **Vocabulary Quiz:** I may quiz you on the meanings of the terms you've learned to ensure retention and understanding.

Remember to schedule your study sessions throughout the day and avoid distractions to maximize your learning efficiency. Consistent review and practical application of vocabulary in conversation will help solidify your knowledge and improve your fluency.


Based on the vocabulary categories provided earlier, here are example sentences using some of those words:


### Employment and Job Interviews

- **Resume/CV:** "I updated my resume to include my most recent job experience."
- **Qualifications:** "The job posting listed the qualifications necessary for the position."
- **Interview:** "I have a job interview scheduled for next week."

### Technology (Software and Hardware)

- **Application (App):** "The application on my phone helps me manage my daily tasks."
- **Operating System (OS):** "My computer runs on the latest operating system."
- **Database:** "The company maintains a large database of customer information."

### Daily Life Activities

- **Groceries:** "I need to go to the store to buy groceries for the week."
- **Transportation:** "Public transportation in this city is very efficient."
- **Dining:** "We're dining at a new restaurant downtown tonight."

### Idiomatic Expressions

- **Break the ice:** "To break the ice at the party, we played a few rounds of trivia."
- **Piece of cake:** "The math problem was a piece of cake for her."
- **Out of the blue:** "He called me out of the blue after not speaking for years."

Best regards,
Professor Judy
