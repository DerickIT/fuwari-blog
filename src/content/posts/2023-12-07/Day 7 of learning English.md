Hello Derick,


Here's your study plan for the seventh day of the first week:


### Day 7: Review and Practice


**Morning Session:**

- Begin with a comprehensive review of everything you've learned this week: the alphabet, numbers, days of the week, basic greetings and phrases, common verbs and subjects, and basic adjectives.
- Use flashcards or notes to test your recall of vocabulary and phrases.

**Afternoon Session:**

- Engage in listening and speaking practice. You can use language learning apps or online resources to listen to dialogues and repeat after them.
- Write down simple sentences or dialogues using the vocabulary and grammar you've learned.

**Evening Session:**

- Have a review session where you go over any areas you found challenging during the week.
- Prepare a few questions or topics for a conversation with me, focusing on the material covered this week.

### Verification of Learning Results:

- **Self-Recording**: Record yourself speaking or having a simulated conversation to check your pronunciation and fluency.
- **Written Exercise**: Write a short paragraph using the vocabulary and grammar points you've learned.
- **Live Conversation**: Have a conversation with me where you can apply what you've learned in a real-life context.
