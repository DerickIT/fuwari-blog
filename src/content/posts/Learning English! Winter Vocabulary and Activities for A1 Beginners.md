Okay, today we're gonna talk about winter. This isn't my favorite topic because I prefer other seasons, but it's winter now, so let's talk about it. In most places, the weather is cold during winter. I don't live in a very cold area, but I still feel uncomfortable during this season. I don't have a heating system in my apartment. This means that my apartment isn't warm during winter. So we have to use extra blankets and wear warm clothes inside. And of course, every time we go outside, we have to wear warm clothes too.


今天我们要谈论冬天。这不是我最喜欢的话题，因为我更喜欢其他季节，但现在是冬天，所以让我们来谈谈它。在大多数地方，冬天的天气很冷。我不住在非常寒冷的地区，但在这个季节我仍然感到不舒服。我的公寓里没有供暖系统。这意味着我的公寓在冬天不温暖。所以我们不得不使用额外的毯子，在里面穿上暖和的衣服。当然，每次我们外出时，我们也得穿上暖和的衣服。


In my city, we often have cloudy weather or sometimes rainy weather during this season. I don't like this, but the worst part of winter is that the days are shorter. The sun goes down really early. Normally in the summer, the sun sets around 7:30 or 8pm in my city. However, in December, it sets before 5pm many people don't like this because they don't have many opportunities to enjoy this sunlight. When they finish working, it's already dark outside. This can be depressing. I try to start working early in the morning so I can finish early. This way I can have some hours of sunlight after I'm done with work. In general, I love the sun, so I prefer long summer days, not short winter days.


在我的城市，这个季节我们经常有多云的天气，有时还会下雨。我不喜欢这样，但冬天最糟糕的部分是白天变短了。太阳很早就下山了。通常在夏天，我城市的太阳大约在晚上7点半或8点落山。然而，在12月，太阳在下午5点之前就落山了，很多人不喜欢这样，因为他们没有太多机会享受阳光。当他们下班时，外面已经很黑了。这可能会让人感到沮丧。我尽量在早上早点开始工作，这样我就能早点完成。这样我下班后还能享受几个小时的阳光。总的来说，我喜欢太阳，所以我更喜欢漫长的夏日，而不是短暂的冬日。


Okay, now let's talk about some winter activities. Of course, some of the funnest winter activities involve snow or ice. For example, it's common to go skiing or snowboarding during this time. In the US, there are many ski resorts where people can practice these sports. If you don't know how to ski or snowboard, you can also try sledding. Sledding is the activity where you sit on something and slide down a hill. It's easy and fun.


现在让我们来谈谈一些冬季活动。当然，一些最有趣的冬季活动涉及到雪或冰。例如，这个时候去滑雪或单板滑雪是很常见的。在美国，有很多滑雪场，人们可以在这些地方练习这些运动。如果你不会滑雪或单板滑雪，你也可以尝试雪橇。雪橇是一种你坐在某物上然后滑下山坡的活动。它既简单又有趣。


Another fun thing you can do in the snow is have a snowball fight. This is where you throw balls of snow at other people. Everyone likes throwing snowballs at people.


在雪地里你可以做的另一件有趣的事是打雪仗。这就是你把雪球扔向其他人。大家都喜欢向人扔雪球。


One other winter sport is ice skating. There are many places to ice skate in the US, even in the middle of big cities. I'm terrible at ice skating, but I still think it's fun. The only bad part is when you fall because it hurts. Trust me.


另一种冬季运动是滑冰。在美国，即使在大城市的中心，也有很多滑冰的地方。我滑冰很糟糕，但仍然觉得很有趣。唯一的不好之处就是当你摔倒时，因为那会很疼。相信我。


Okay, now let's talk about winter holidays and traditions. For me, the best part of winter is Christmas. I don't usually like holidays, but I love Christmas. My family had several Christmas traditions that I'll always remember. For example, we always decorated the Christmas tree together with the same ornaments every year.


好的，现在让我们谈谈冬季假期和传统。对我来说，冬季最好的部分是圣诞节。我通常不喜欢假期，但我爱圣诞节。我的家庭有几个我将永远记得的圣诞传统。例如，我们总是每年一起用相同的装饰品装饰圣诞树。


Another tradition that I like is going to see the beautiful lights and decorations in different neighborhoods. I'm excited to start new Christmas traditions with my own family. Many people around the world also celebrate New Year's Eve. In the US, a lot of people turn on the TV to watch the New Year's Eve party in New York City. I did this when I was younger, but nowadays this holiday isn't really important to me.


我喜欢的另一个传统是去不同社区欣赏美丽的灯光和装饰。我期待着与自己的家人开始新的圣诞节传统。世界各地的许多人也庆祝除夕夜。在美国，很多人会打开电视观看纽约市的除夕夜派对。我年轻时这样做过，但现在这个节日对我来说并不那么重要了。


I like Christmas, but not New Year's Eve. However, when I'm with my wife's family, I have to celebrate this holiday with them.


我喜欢圣诞节，但不喜欢新年前夕。然而，当我和妻子的家人在一起时，我必须和他们一起庆祝这个节日。
