### Week 12, Day 5: Writing and Comprehension


**Learning Content:**

- **Essay Writing:** Learn how to write a structured essay in English, focusing on an introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion. The topic should relate to your daily life, work, or an aspect of software technology you find fascinating.
- **Reading Comprehension:** Improve your ability to understand complex English texts. Read an article or watch a video on a complex topic, then practice summarizing the main points and expressing your opinion on the subject.

**Testing Standards:**

- **Essay Evaluation:** Your essay will be evaluated based on structure, coherence, vocabulary use, grammar accuracy, and the depth of your analysis. Aim for a clear thesis statement, well-developed paragraphs, and a strong conclusion.
- **Comprehension Test:** After reading an article or watching a video, you will be asked to summarize it and discuss its main points. Your ability to identify key information, infer meanings, and articulate your views will be assessed.

**Verification:**

- **Written Submission:** Submit your essay for feedback. This will allow you to understand your strengths and areas for improvement in writing.
- **Oral Presentation:** Present your summary and opinion of the article or video you studied. This can be done in a conversation with me or in a group setting, providing practice in speaking and listening as well as reading and writing.

By focusing on these activities, you will enhance your ability to express complex ideas in writing and improve your comprehension of advanced English texts, further developing your conversational fluency in English.
