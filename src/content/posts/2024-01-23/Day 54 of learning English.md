Dear Derick,


On the second day of the ninth week, we will focus on understanding and using the passive voice in English. Here's your plan for the day:


**Morning Session (1 hour):**

- Study the passive voice, which is used when the focus is on the action or the object of the sentence rather than the subject. For example, "The software was updated by the developer" instead of "The developer updated the software."
- Learn how to form the passive voice with the verb "to be" and the past participle of the main verb.
- Go through examples of passive voice in technology-related sentences.

**Evening Session (30 minutes):**

- Complete exercises that involve converting sentences from active to passive voice and vice versa. This will help you understand how the structure changes and when to use each form.
- Try to create sentences that could be used in your daily work or in discussions about software technology.

**Verification of Study Results:**

- Send me the sentences you've converted or created. I will review them to ensure you are using the passive voice correctly and provide feedback or corrections if necessary.

Understanding the passive voice will enhance your ability to read and write about processes and actions in English, which is particularly useful in technical fields. Keep practicing, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions.
