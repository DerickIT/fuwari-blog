Remember to take breaks between sessions to rest and process the information. Consistency and practice are crucial, so stick to the plan and reach out if you encounter any difficulties[2][3][4].


Based on the guidance from the search results, it's clear that vocabulary is a fundamental building block in language learning and should be prioritized, especially in the early stages. However, grammar is also essential for constructing correct sentences and should not be neglected. Therefore, for the second day of the fifth week, we will focus on both vocabulary and grammar.
