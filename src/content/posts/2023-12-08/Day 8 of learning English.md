Remember, practice is key when learning a new language. Try to use the new words and grammar rules in your daily life. You can also use language learning apps or websites for additional practice.


**Morning Session: Vocabulary Building**

- Start with a review of the words you learned the previous day.

- Write sentences using each new word to understand its context.

**Afternoon Session: Grammar - Present Simple Tense**

- Review the structure of the present simple tense.
- Practice making sentences using the present simple tense. Try to incorporate the new words you learned in the morning session.

**Evening Session: Practice and Review**

- Listen to a simple English conversation or story. Try to identify the new words and the usage of the present simple tense.
- Practice speaking by retelling the story or conversation. Record your speech for self-assessment.
- Review the day's learning. Write down any questions or difficulties you encountered.

Remember, consistency is key in language learning. Try to immerse yourself in the language as much as possible. Listen to English songs, watch English movies or shows, and try to think in English. This will help you become more familiar with the language and improve your fluency.
