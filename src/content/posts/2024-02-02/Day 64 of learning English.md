On the fifth day of Week 10 in the study plan, you should complete the following specific tasks:

1. **Review Chunk D**: Spend 30 minutes reviewing the material you prepared on the fourth day. This review should be active, involving self-testing and evaluating your learning to ensure you understand the material well[5].
2. **Review Chunk C**: Dedicate 15 minutes to review the material you prepared on the third day to reinforce your learning[5].
3. **Review Chunk B and A**: Spend another 15 minutes reviewing the material from the first and second day to aid in long-term retention[5].
4. **Interactive Activities**: Engage in interactive activities that reinforce the vocabulary and phonemic awareness you've been working on. This could involve playing educational games, having conversations in English, or writing short paragraphs using the vocabulary words you've learned[5].
5. **Reflection and Planning**: Spend the remaining time reflecting on your progress this week. Identify areas of strength and areas needing improvement. Plan adjustments for next week's study plan based on this reflection.

These tasks are designed to follow a structured approach to learning, breaking down the material into manageable chunks and reviewing them progressively to enhance understanding and retention.
