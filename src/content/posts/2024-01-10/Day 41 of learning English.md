On the first day of Week 7, you can focus on both vocabulary and grammar. Here's a detailed plan:


## Vocabulary Learning

1. **Use Flashcards**: Use online platforms like Quizlet to study and memorize flashcards. For example, you can start with the flashcards containing terms like "Implacable", "Jurisdiction", "Paroxysm" and more[1].
2. **Learn a Word of the Day**: You can follow a "Word of the Day" series on platforms like YouTube to learn new words. For instance, the word "Superfluous" is the word of the week in one of the episodes[2].
3. **Specialized and Academic Vocabulary**: If you're interested in software technology, you can start learning specialized vocabulary related to this field. Open University provides resources for learning new specialized and academic vocabulary[3].

## Grammar Learning

1. **Use Online Resources**: There are numerous online resources that provide grammar exercises and explanations. You can dedicate a portion of your study time to learning a new grammar concept and practicing it.
2. **Practice Writing**: Writing sentences using the new vocabulary and grammar concepts you've learned can help reinforce your understanding. You can write a short paragraph or a few sentences every day.

## Verification of Study Results

1. **Flashcard Tests**: After studying the flashcards, you can test your memory by going through the flashcards again and trying to recall the meanings of the words[1].
2. **Writing Assessment**: You can assess your understanding of the new grammar concepts by checking if your sentences are grammatically correct.
3. **Conversation Practice**: You can practice using the new vocabulary and grammar concepts in conversations about software technology or daily life. This can be done with a language exchange partner, a tutor, or even a language learning app.

Remember, consistency is key in language learning. Try to dedicate a specific amount of time each day to studying English, and gradually increase the intensity of your studies as your proficiency improves.


Here are some effective ways to practice speaking English on a limited schedule:

1. **Set aside dedicated time**: Treat your English practice like an important appointment. Even if it's just 15-30 minutes a day, consistent practice is key[2].
2. **Use technology and online resources**: Language learning apps offer convenient ways to practice speaking with native speakers. You can also use English pronunciation apps[3][4].
3. **Find a language buddy or study group**: Having someone to practice with regularly can provide accountability and motivation. Schedule regular meetups or online sessions where you can have conversations[2].
4. **Integrate English into your everyday life**: Listen to English podcasts during your commute, watch movies or TV shows in English with subtitles, or even think and talk to yourself in English throughout the day[2].
5. **Talk to yourself in English**: This can help you get used to speaking the language and can be done whenever you have some free time[3].
6. **Use English in real-life situations**: Try to use English in your daily life as much as possible. For example, you could order food in English, ask for directions, or have a conversation with a friend[1].
7. **Participate in public speaking events**: If possible, participate in events like open debates, spoken word readings, and improvised storytelling gatherings. These are places where you can practice speaking English[3].
8. **Narrate your world**: Describe what you're doing or planning to do in English. This can be done silently or out loud[4].
9. **Sing along to English songs**: This is a fun way to improve your pronunciation and fluency[4].

Remember, the key to improving your English speaking skills is regular and consistent practice. Even if you only have a limited amount of time each day, making the most of that time can lead to significant improvements.
